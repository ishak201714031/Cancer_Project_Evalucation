No definite\nglandular or papillary architecture seen. There is a marked admixed\nlymphoplasmacytic infiltrate. Selected slides were reviewed by Dr. **NAME[M. ZZZ]\nwith concurrence.\n\nINTRAOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:\nFSA:  Uterus: Greater than 50% invasion into myometrium. (**INITIALS)\nGROSS DESCRIPTION:  Number of specimen containers: 1.  Received unfixed,\nlabeled with patient name **NAME[AAA BBB] and MRN **ID-NUM.\nA.   The specimen is a 115 gram specimen including uterus measuring 9 x 5 x\n4 cm.  Right fallopian tube measuring 5 cm in length and 0.6 cm in\ndiameter.  Right ovary measuring 2.6 x 2.6 x 1 cm.  Left fallopian tube\nmeasuring 5 cm in length and 0.5 cm in diameter and left ovary measuring\n2.5 x 2 x 1.5 cm.  The endometrium has a tan-pink lining with a 5 x 4 x 2\ncm mass on the anterior and posterior walls.  There appears to be invasion\nof the underlying myometrium to a depth of greater than 75% of the\nmyometrium.  The area of deepest invasion appears to be the posterior lower\nuterine segments where the tumor approaches within 3 mm of the serosal\nsurface.  The myometrium deep to the visible tumor; however, is firm to the\ntouch and extension of the tumor into the myometrium may be greater.  The\nfundus appears to not have tumor involvement.  In the uninvolved uterus,\nthe endometrium measures 1 mm in thickness and the myometrium 2.1 cm in\nthickness.  Bilateral fallopian tubes are patent and have fimbriated ends.\nThe right ovary has a smooth outer surface and is unremarkable on cross\nsection. The left ovary has a smooth outer surface and a single, smooth\nwalled fluid-filled sac measuring 2.5 x 2 x 1.5 cm.  The fluid-filled sac has compressed the\nremaining ovarian tissue to the superior aspects of the ovary.  Cassettes\nsubmitted as follows:  A1   remainder of frozen section; A2   posterior\nvaginal cuff; A3   anterior and posterior cervix, anterior has an inked\nserosal surface, posterior contains a piece of posterior vaginal cuff; A4\nanterior lower uterine segment cut longitudinally; A5   posterior lower\nuterine segment and cervix cut and cross section with tumor closest extent\nto the serosal surface; A6   normal appearing posterior fundus\nfull-thickness; A7   anterior body full-thickness with intramural whorled\nsmall lump; A8   posterior body full-thickness; A9   anterior fundus\nfull-thickness; A10   left lateral parametrial tissue; A11   right lateral\nparametrial tissue; A12   cross section of left fallopian tube and left\novary with fluid-filled sac wall; A13   representative section of left ovary; A14\ncross section of right fallopian tube and right ovary; A15   representative\nsection of right ovary.\nB.

The specimen has been received oriented per the surgeon with a short suture designating the superior resection margin and a long suture designating the lateral resection margin.  The overlying ellipse of lightly pigmented skin is 26.7 cm medial to lateral x 16.2 cm superior to inferior.  The nipple-areolar complex is 9.0 cm in diameter.  The everted nipple is 1.0 x 1.0 x 0.5 cm.  The skin surface is remarkable for a 7.0 cm in length x 0.1 cm in average diameter well-healed surgical scar involving the upper outer quadrant.  Additional skin masses or lesions are not grossly identified.  The specimen is differentially inked in order to allow for the microscopic evaluation of surgical removal of tissue surgical borders in the following manner:  superior-anterior blue, inferior-anterior green, and posterior black.  Sectioning of the mastectomy reveals a 5.5 x 2.5 x 1.5 cm mass within the upper outer quadrant.  This mass comes to within 2.0 cm of the overlying skin, 4.0 cm of the posterior resection margin, 4.0 cm of the nearest superior-anterior resection margin, and 9.0 cm from the nearest inferior-anterior resection margin.  Present within the central aspect of the mass is a metallic clip.  Additional distinct breast masses, lesions or prior tissue sampling sites are not grossly identified.  The remainder of the mastectomy grossly appears to be comprised of approximately 75% yellow glistening adipose tissue and 25% white to pink fibrous tissue.  Dissection of the axillary tail reveals fifteen lymph node candidates ranging in greatest dimension from 0.6 cm to 3.0 cm.  The largest lymph node candidate which represents the highest lymph node within the axillary tail has a cut surface which is remarkable for a white to gray gritty cut surface as well as bleeding and tissue death.  This lymph node grossly appears to have been previously biopsied.  The identified lymph nodes are submitted in their entirety.  SUMMARY OF SECTIONS:  A1 nipple, A2 skin scar found on upper outer quadrant, A3-A6 mass from upper outer quadrant, A7 mass from upper outer quadrant with overlying skin, A8 superior-anterior resection margin of breast mass, A9 inferior-anterior resection margin of breast mass, A10 posterior resection margin of breast mass, A11 uninvolved breast tissue from upper inner quadrant, A12 uninvolved breast tissue from lower inner quadrant, A13 uninvolved breast tissue from lower outer quadrant, A14 uninvolved breast tissue from upper outer quadrant, A15 six intact lymph nodes, A16 six intact lymph nodes, A17 one lymph node bisected, A18-A19 largest and highest lymph node within axillary tail serially sectioned.\n**INITIALS  **DATE[Jun 12 12]\n\n<MICROSCOPIC>\nH&E-stained sections examined.  Slide A18 shows an involved lymph node, 1.7 cm in greatest dimension.  Tumor is identified outside of the lymph node capsule.  This may represent extracapsular lymph node extension, tumor tracking along the previous tissue sampling site, or direct tumor extension into the lymph node. \nThis case has undergone prospective intradepartmental quality assurance review prior to verification.\nAK/cs  **DATE[Jun 13 12]\n\n\n<FINAL DX>\nBREAST, LEFT, RADICAL MASTECTOMY, INCLUDING SKIN, NIPPLE AND AXILLARY TAIL:\n  INFILTRATING CANCER DUCTAL MALIGNANT EPITHELIAL TUMOR WITH THE FOLLOWING FEATURES:\n  1.

The absence of an ALK rearrangement suggest that the patient may not respond to ALK \n    inhibitors.  Clinical correlation is suggested.\n\n    Reference range:\n    Not Detected:  Less than or equal to 15% of cells with split signals (3  ALK and 5  ALK signals apart by greater \n    than 2 times signal size or single 3  ALK signal) in 50 cells scored.\n    Detected:  Greater than 15% of cells with split signals (3  ALK and 5  ALK signals apart by greater than 2 times \n    signal size or single 3  ALK signal) in 50 cells scored.\n\n    Methodology:\n    After deferring the tumor area on an H\\T\\E slide form this formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) patient \n    specimen, ALK gene rearrangement was assessed utilizing the LSI ALK Dual Color, Break Apart Probe assay \n    (**NAME[WWW] Molecular).  The identification probes for LSI ALK 5  probe (SpectrumGreen) and LSI ALK 3  probe \n    (SpectrumOrange) were hybridized according to the manufacturer s guidelines.  At least 50 non-overlapping \n    nuclei were analyzed and the localization of the LSI ALK 5  probe (green) and LSI ALK 3  probe (orange) signals \n    were recorded and interpreted.\n\n    Intended Use:\n    The LSI ALK (Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase) dual Color, Break Apart Rearrangement Probe (Abbot Molecular) is \n    designed to detect rearrangements of the ALK gene.  Fusion of the ALK gene with the echinoderm microtubule-\n    associated protein-like 4 gene (EML4-ALK) can be detected in a subset of non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC).  \n    EML4-ALK fusion is observed primarily in lung glandular cancer.  Patient s who harbor this mutation may \n    respond to ALK inhibitors.  Nature 448, 561-566 (2 **DATE[Sep 2007]).

Received fresh for intraoperative consultation, labeled \"sigmoid colon,\" is a resected segment of tan-pink intestinal tissue measuring 15.5 cm in length x 3.0 cm average outside diameter.  One margin is received stapled.  The serosal surface is smooth and tan-pink, with a retracted area on the antimesenteric side, measuring 1.3 cm in greatest dimension.  Opening reveals a tan-pink mucosa with a tan-pink to red lesion measuring 4.0 x 2.5 x 1.3 cm, located 4.0 cm from the stapled margin, >7.0 cm from the open margin.  Sectioning through the lesion reveals gross invasion of the muscle layer with no gross invasion of the surrounding fat.  No further masses or lesions are grossly identified.  Representative sections are submitted in blocks A1-A14.  \n\n  SECTION SUMMARY:\n  A1  -  Stapled margin\n  A2  -  Open margin  \n  A3-A6  -  Sections through lesion\n  A7-A10  -  Lymph nodes\n  A11-A14-  Additional node dissection\n\nB.  Received fresh for intraoperative consultation, labeled \"cecal growth protruding from a mucous membrane,\" is an excision of tan-pink soft tissue measuring 1.4 x 10 x 0.3 cm.  The specimen is submitted for a frozen section and subsequently submitted in block B.\n\nC.  Received in formalin labeled \"colon donuts\" are two ring-shaped fragments of tan-pink intestinal tissue measuring, in aggregate, 2.4 x 2.2 x 2.2 cm. Representative sections are submitted in blocks C1-C2.\n\nD.  Received in formalin labeled \"appendix\" is a tan-pink appendix measuring 5.3 cm in length x 0.7 cm average outside diameter.  The serosal surface is smooth and tan-pink.  Sectioning reveals a constricted lumen and grossly normal mucosa.  Representative sections are submitted in block D.\n\nE.  Received in formalin labeled \"cecum staple line\" is a segment of tan-pink intestinal tissue measuring 3.5 x 1.1 x 1.1 cm.  There is a suture line seen along the long axis of the specimen.  A representative section is submitted in block E.\nMicroscopicDescription:\nA.  Proximal and distal surgical borders are free of malignant epithelial tumor.  The mucosal mass is an infiltrating cancer, moderately-differentiated glandular cancer invading into, but not through, the muscularis propria.  Some nests of tumor exhibit surrounding retraction artifact, but distinct vascular infiltration by cancer is not identified.  Initial dissection demonstrates only eight small lymph nodes/lymphoid aggregates, all negative for spread of cancer.  Additional dissection for nodes demonstrates seven additional nodes, all negative for spread of cancer, for a total of 15 nodes, all negative for spread of cancer. \n\nB.  Sections of colonic mucosa and submucosa demonstrate a sessile hyperplastic growth protruding from a mucous membrane.  Margins of the mucosal resection appear free of growth protruding from a mucous membrane.  There is moderate chronic inflammation with scattered reactive lymphoid aggregates.  \n\nC.  Sections of donuts demonstrate non-cancerous colonic mucosa.  \n\nD.  Sections of appendix are free of acute inflammation.  \n\nE.  Sections of colon exhibit a small, 0.3 cm adenomatous growth protruding from a mucous membrane.\nA: Sigmoid colon\nB: Cecal growth protruding from a mucous membrane\nC: Colon donuts\nD: Appendix\nE: Cecum staple line\n"

The specimen averages 5.0 cm in diameter.  There is an attached 7.0 x 0.6 cm appendix..  Also attached is a 10.5 cm segment of terminal ileum averaging 2.8 cm in diameter.  Attached to the outside edge toward the distal resection margin is a 20.0 x 15.0 x 1.0 cm soft yellow unremarkable portion of omentum.  On opening the specimen located 14.5 cm distal to the ileocecal valve and approximately 20 cm distal to the proximal ileal margin with extension to within 15 cm of the distal colon margin is a circumferential raised tan red focally ulcerated and lobulated tumor mass which involves the full wall thickness with extension to within less than 1 mm of the serosal which will be inked in blue.  The tumor measures up to 3.5 cm in thickness, approximately 6.0 x 6.0 cm in cross dimensions.  The tumor is grossly situated 3 cm away from the closest fatty vascular pedicle radial margin.  Also noted 2.5 cm proximal to the edge of the tumor on the mucosa is a raised tan red 0.5 cm growth protruding from a mucous membrane.  Also there appears to be some black dye injected into the colon wall at the site of the tumor.  On sectioning the appendix there is a lumen varying from 0.1-0.2 cm in diameter and a wall varying from 0.2-0.4 cm in thickness.  No area of rupture is identified.  The remaining colon and ileal mucosa is tan pink with no additional gross lesions identified.

The node was entirely submitted.\n\nTOUCH PREP DIAGNOSIS: NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT EPITHELIAL TUMOR\n\nPART 2: RIGHT BREAST\n(**INITIALS) Received in formalin labeled **NAME[AAA BBB], designated \"\"right breast, suture marks axillary\"\" is an apparent simple mastectomy specimen weighing 430 grams and measuring 20 cm medial-lateral, 16.5 cm superior-inferior and up to 3 cm anterior-posterior. The axillary area of the excision is marked with a suture on the container label and requisition form. The specimen is also surmounted by an elliptoid portion of yellow-pink skin measuring 15.5 x 8.5 cm. The nipple is everted measuring 1.4 cm. The skin is notable for two red-maroon, flat, discolored lesions, each measuring 0.2 cm in greatest dimension. The specimen is inked as follows: superior-green, inferior-orange, medial-red, lateral-purple, and deep posterior-black. Sectioning the breast reveals a solid, firm, suspicious-appearing neoplasm in the central superior aspect of the excision. The lesion measures 2.2 x 2 cm. It is removed from the cutaneous and inked soft tissue margin. The nearest inked margin to the lesion are the green and black inked soft tissue margin at a distance of 1.5 cm each. The lesion on cut section features solid hemorrhagic areas, along with a deeply embedded metallic clip. The remainder of the breast tissue parenchyma is composed mainly of bright yellow fatty tissue with strips of pink-white fibrous tissue. No other suspicious mass is grossly appreciated. Thorough examination of the superior-lateral most aspect of the excision reveals two lymph node/small lumps measuring 0.6 and 1.9 cm in greatest dimension which are fat replaced on cut section. \n\nSummary of sections: 2a-sections skin and nipple; 2b-green inked soft tissue margin close to breast lesion; 2c-black inked soft tissue margin close to breast lesion; 2d through 2f-representative sections breast lesion central superior breast; 2g, 2h-sections upper outer quadrant of breast; 2i, 2j-sections lower outer quadrant of breast; 2k, 2l-sections upper inner quadrant of breast; 2m, 2n-sections lower inner quadrant of breast; 2o-two bisected axillary lymph nodes/small lumps\n \nPART 3: HIGHEST LEFT AXILLARY NODE \n(**INITIALS) Received in formalin labeled **NAME[AAA BBB], designated \"\"highest left axillary node\"\" is a portion of fatty yellow tissue measuring 1.4 x 1 x 0.3 cm. Trimming of this fatty tissue reveals two somewhat matted lymph nodes. Entirely submitted in cassette 3a. \n \nPART 4: LEFT MODIFIED MASTECTOMY \n(**INITIALS) Received in formalin labeled **NAME[AAA BBB], designated \"\"left modified mastectomy, suture marks axilla\"\" is a modified radical mastectomy specimen weighing 457 grams. The axillary tail is marked with a suture. The breast tissue portion measures 15.5 cm medial-lateral, 15 cm superior-inferior and up to 4 cm anterior-posterior. The axillary tail measures 8 x 6 x 1.5 cm. The specimen is surmounted by an elliptoid portion of yellow-pink skin measuring 16 x 8.5 cm. The nipple is everted measuring 1.3 cm. The 4 to 8 o'clock aspect of the areola complex has a purple-red discoloration. Otherwise, no skin lesion is grossly appreciated. The specimen is inked as follows: superior-green, inferior-orange, medial-red, lateral-purple, deep posterior-black. Sectioning the breast reveals an ill-defined malignant appearing neoplasm in the central upper outer quadrant of the breast. The lesion measures 3 x 2.2 cm. The lesion has a solid, smooth, yellow-white cut surface with strips of hemorrhagic areas. The lesion is also remote from the cutaneous and inked soft tissue surgical borders. The nearest inked surgical borders of the lesion are the green and black inked soft tissue surgical borders with a distance of 1 cm each. The rest of the breast tissue parenchyma is composed of bright yellow fatty tissue alternating with pink-white, fibrous tissue. No other suspicious mass is grossly appreciated. Thorough examination of the attached axillary tail reveals several lymph nodes ranging from 0.3 up to 2.8 cm in greatest dimension. \n\nSummary of sections: 4a-sections of skin and nipple; 4b-sections green and black inked soft tissue surgical borders close to breast lesion; 4c, 4d-representative sections breast lesion; 4e, 4f-additional representative section of breast lesion divided in two blocks; 4g, 4h-section upper inner quadrant of breast; 4i, 4j-sections lower inner quadrant of breast; 4k, 4l-upper outer quadrant of breast away from breast lesion; 4m, 4n-sections lower outer quadrant of breast; 4o-multiple intact lymph nodes; 4p-two bisected nodes; 4q, 4r-one bisected lymph node each block; 4s-representative cross section largest axillary node.<DIAGNOSIS COMMENTS>\nIntraoperative Consult Dx::\nNONE<MICROSCOPIC>\nPART 1: RIGHT SENTINEL NODE TISSUE SAMPLING \nTouch preps and H&E stained slides examined. \n \nPART 2: RIGHT BREAST \nH&E stained slides and one immunohistochemical stain examined. The slides contain multiple representative sections of a mastectomy. A malignant epithelial tumor is present with associated localized tumor disease. Immunohistochemistry shows the localized tumor component to lack E-cadherin and the infiltrating cancer component to have patchy E-cadherin reactivity. \n \nPART 3: HIGHEST LEFT AXILLARY NODE \nSlide examined. \n \nPART 4: LEFT MODIFIED MASTECTOMY \nSlides examined. An infiltrating cancer malignant epithelial tumor is present which measures 2.3 cm. This malignant epithelial tumor is similar to the previous but shows more ductal morphologic features and has a small component of ductal malignant epithelial tumor localized tumor. E-cadherin is positive. \n\n\n\nNOTE: Some of the tests reported here may have been developed and performance characteristics determined by Laboratories Northwest.

It consists of an oriented fibroadipose tissue tissue fragment weighing 66 grams and \nmeasuring 8.5 cm from superior to inferior, 6.5 cm from medial to lateral and 2.5 cm from \nanterior to posterior. The tail end of a localization guidewire extends centrally from the anterior \naspect. \nWIth the provided orientation the specimen is inked as follows: \nMedial-Red \nLateral-Yellow \nSuperior-Orange \nInferior-Green \nAnterior-Blue \nDeep-Black \n\nThe specimen is serially sectioned from superior towards inferior into 12 slices with the hooked \nend of the guidewire terminating in slice 3. Sectioning reveals an indurated tan-white slightly ill-\ndefined mass occupying slices 6-8 and grossly measuring 1.2 x 1.2 x 1.5 cm. Grossly the \nmass is 0.1 cm from the anterior margin (slice 6), 1.5 cm from the lateral margin, 1.5 cm from \nthe medial margin, 2 cm from the deep margin, 2 cm from the inferior margin and 2.5 cm from \nthe superior margin. The remainder of the specimen shows soft yellow fatty cut surfaces with a \nminimal fibrous component, although there is some dense fibrous tissue laterally adjacent to the \nmass in slice 8 which abuts the inked margin. There are otherwise no definite areas of \nabnormality. \nSections are submitted as follows:A1-Perpendicular sections of slice 1 with superior margin. \nA2-Representative fibrous tissue in slice 4. \nA3-Fibrous tissue superiorly adjacent to mass, slice 5. \nA4-Slice 6, superior extent of mass with nearest inked anterior margin. \nA5-Slice 6, tissue and deep margin posterior adjacent to mass. \nA6-Tissue and medial margin adjacent to mass. \n\nA9-A10-Slice 8, mass in this slice with anterior and lateral surgical borders (one section bisected). \nA11-Slice 9, fibrous tissue inferiorly adjacent to mass. \nA12-Representative perpendicular sections of slice 12 with inferior margin. \n\nPart B is designated 'sentinel nodes 1-3'. It consists of a soft to rubbery yellow-red fatty tissue \nfragment measuring 6 x 3.8 x 1.3 cm. Palpation and dissection of this tissue reveals three soft \nto rubbery yellow-red probable lymph nodes ranging from 1-2.5 cm in maximum dimension. \n\nThe nodes are submitted as follows: \nB1-One node bisected. \nB2-One node bisected. \nB3-B4-One node quadrisected. \n\nPart C is designated 'additional right anterior margin'. It consists of an unoriented rubbery \nyellow-red fatty tissue fragment weighing 4.2 grams and measuring 4 x 3.5 x 1 cm. One aspect \nis slightly coarse and is the assumed old margin and the opposite lobulated assumed new \nmargin is inked blue. The tissue is serially sectioned revealing uniform soft yellow-red fatty cut \nsurfaces with no gross masses or areas of abnormality. The tissue is entirely submitted in C1C3. \n\nPart D is designated 'right breast anterior lateral'. It consists of two unoriented yellow-red fatty \ntissue fragments together weighing 6.6 grams. The fragments measure 3.5 x 1.5 x 0.4 cm and \n5.3 x 2.5 x 1 cm. Each has a slightly coarse flat assumed old margin and the opposite lobulated \nassumed new margin is inked blue. Each fragment is serially sectioned revealing uniform soft \nyellow-red fibroadipose tissue cut surfaces with no gross lesions or areas of induration. The specimen is \nentirely submitted in D1-D5. \nPart E is designated 'right anterior margin'. It consists of a tissue fragment weighing 3.3 grams \nand consists of an elliptical skin fragment measuring 5 x 2 x 1 cm with a 1 cm everted nipple \ncentrally though at one edge. The skin is the new margin and the opposite old/deep margin is \ninked black. The tissue is serially sectioned revealing uniform rubbery tan-white cut surfaces. \nThe tissue is entirely submitted in E1-E3. \n<FINAL DX> \nA.

Received fresh labeled with the patient's name designated 'right axillary sentinel node' is a 2.5 x 1.5 x 1.0 cm fat replaced tan to pink-yellow ovoid lymph node.  This lymph node is bisected and a touch prep is performed yielding the following diagnosis by Dr. **NAME[ZZZ]:  Lymph node, one; negative for malignant epithelial tumor.  The bisected lymph node is submitted in its entirety for permanent sectioning in cassette A1.\nB.  Received in formalin labeled with the patient's name and designated 'right breast tissue' is an oriented right breast lumpectomy measuring 10.5 cm medial to lateral, 7.0 cm superior to inferior, and up to 4.5 cm anterior to posterior.  The specimen has been received oriented per the surgeon with a double suture designating the posterior resection margin, a single suture designating the lateral resection margin, and a localization wire and skin representing the anterior margin.  The overlying ellipse of lightly pigmented skin is 4.5 cm medial to lateral x 1.0 cm superior to inferior.  The skin surface is grossly unremarkable.  A skin mass or lesion is not identified.  The lumpectomy is differentially inked in order to allow for the microscopic evaluation of the surgical removal of tissue surgical borders in the following manner:  The superior resection margin is inked blue, the inferior resection margin is inked green, the medial resection margin is inked violet, the lateral resection margin is inked orange, the anterior resection margin is inked yellow, the posterior resection margin is inked black.  Sectioning of the lumpectomy reveals a gritty white to pink-gray 1.0 x 0.8 x 0.7 cm mass within the anterior-inferior aspect of the lumpectomy.  A spring-like metallic clip is embedded within the mass.  The mass comes to within 0.8 cm of the anterior resection margin, 1.0 cm of the inferior resection margin, 1.5 cm of the superior resection margin, and 2.0 cm of the posterior resection margin.  The mass does not grossly appear to involve the overlying skin ellipse.  Additional distinct breast masses or lesions are not grossly identified.  The remainder of the lumpectomy is comprised of approximately 75% yellow glistening adipose tissue and 25% white to pink fibrous tissue.  The identified mass is submitted in its entirety.  Summary of sections:  B1 medial resection margin, B2 and B3 bicomposite section of uninvolved breast medial to mass, B4 and B5 breast mass with anterior and inferior resection surgical borders, B6 breast mass with anterior, skin, and superior resection margin, B7 and B8 bicomposite section of uninvolved breast tissue lateral to breast mass, B9 lateral resection margin.\n**INITIALS  **DATE[Jun 4 12]\n\n<MICROSCOPIC>\nA-B.

Labeled with\npatient name **NAME[BBB, AAA M] and medical record number **ID-NUM.\nA.   Container designation: \"uterus, cervix, ovaries and tubes\" --\nReceived unfixed is a uterus, cervix with attached bilateral adnexa.  The\nuterine weighs 1.72 grams, 11.0 x 6.0 x 5.5 cm.  The serosa is smooth,\npink-tan.  The ectocervix is pink-tan with scattered petechiae and a 1.0 cm\nslit-like os.  The soft tissue surgical borders are inked and sectioning of the\ncervix demonstrates multiple fluid-filled sacs occupied by clear mucoid material\nmeasuring up to 1.6 cm in greatest dimension, and the endocervical canal is\npatent.  The endometrium measures 0.1 cm in thickness, the anterior and\nposterior fundus demonstrate a pink-tan shaggy area measuring 2.0 x 1.5 x\n0.6 cm superficially invading the myometrium. The myometrium measures 3.0\ncm in maximum thickness and the posterior body and lower uterine segment\ndemonstrate a firm trabeculated indurated appearance in the myometrium,\ngrossly measuring 2.2 cm in greatest dimension which appears to be distinct\nfrom the originally described tumor mass.  Representative section of the\nindurated appearance in the myometrium and anterior fundus tumor are\nsubmitted for frozen section, wrapped and submitted for permanent section\nin cassette A1.  An additional section of the posterior body trabeculated\nmyometrium is submitted for frozen section and resubmitted for permanent in\ncassette A2.  The right ovary measures 3.5 x 2.0 x 2.0 cm and sectioning\ndemonstrates a pink-tan mottled stroma with multiple fluid-filled sacs ranging from 0.2\nto 1.5 cm in greatest dimension occupied by variably clear watery to\nsanguinous fluid.  The purple-red fallopian tube with fimbriated end\nmeasures 4.5 cm in length, up to 0.8 cm in external diameter and\ndemonstrates a paratubal fluid-filled sac, 3.2 cm in greatest dimension occupied by\nclear watery fluid.  The left ovary measures 4.0 x 3.0 x 2.5 cm upon\nsectioning demonstrates multiple fluid-filled sacs varying from 0.3 to 1.8 cm in\ngreatest dimension occupied by hemorrhagic material.  The corresponding\npurple-red fallopian tube with fimbriated end measures 4.5 cm in length,\n0.8 cm in external diameter and sectioning demonstrates a pinpoint lumen.\nA paratubal fluid-filled sac is identified measuring 1.0 cm in greatest dimension\noccupied by clear watery fluid.

The surgical margin is inked and\nthe specimen is cross-sectioned along the short axis, wrapped and submitted\nentirely in A1 and A2 with cassette A1 containing the ends of the ellipse.\nB.   Container designation: \"inferolateral margin of prior lumpectomy\" --\nReceived unfixed and oriented by the surgeon is a portion of mammary\ntissue, 11 grams, 5 x 4 x 1.5 cm.  Short and long double sutures identify\nthe superior lateral and deep surgical borders, which are inked as follows:\nsuperior blue, inferior black, deep green, previous tissue sampling cavity yellow,\nmedial red.  The specimen is cross-sectioned along the short axis\ndemonstrating a parenchyma comprised predominantly of yellow glistening\nadipose tissue (80%) interspersed with gray fibrous tissue (20%) and in the\narea of the previous tissue sampling cycle then yellow flecks.  The specimen is\nsubmitted entirely and sequentially from superior to inferior in cassette\nB1-B12.\nC.   Container designation: \"superior margin of prior lumpectomy left\nbreast\" --  Received unfixed and oriented by the surgeon is a portion of\nmammary tissue 11 grams, 5 x 3.5 x 2.0 cm.  The superior short long and\ndouble sutures identify the superior lateral and deep surgical borders respectively.\nThe surgical borders are inked as follows:  Superior blue, lateral orange, deep\ngreen, previous tissue sampling site yellow.  Careful sectioning demonstrates yellow\nglistening homogenous cut surfaces throughout.  No discrete lesions are\ngrossly identified.  The specimen is submitted entirely and sequentially\nfrom superior towards inferior.\n\n(Dictated by: **NAME[ZZZ YYY], PA) (Resident:  **NAME[XXX WWW], MD)\nMICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION: Histologic examination performed.\n\nThe staff pathologist was present during the formal review and\ninterpretation of all slides and ancillary studies, (if performed), with\nthe medical student or resident.\n\n\n\n**NAME[VVV UUU] TTT] PhD\n\nElectronically signed **DATE[May 27 2012] 06:13 PM\nSPECIMENS SUBMITTED:\nA.

MHB/mbc\nGross Description Specimen 1 received in formalin labeled left breast is a 960 gram, 24.0 x 19.0 x 6.0cm intact left simple mastectomy specimen.  The specimen is partially surfaced by 17.0 x 9.0cm tan wrinkled skin ellipse.  The everted nipple measures 1.5cm in diameter.  The surgical borders are inked as follows: superficial margin  black, deep margin  blue, and sectioning reveals a 1.8 x 1.5 x 1.5cm ill-defined tan firm mass, 2.8cm from the deep margin and 2.4cm from the superficial margin.  The mass is located in the upper inner quadrant.  There is an area of firm nodular fibrofluid-filled sacic breast tissue located in the lower outer quadrant.  This area is greater than 12.0cm from the primary mass.  No definitive infiltrating cancer tumor is identified in this area.  There are a few small lymph nodes identified in the upper outer quadrant.  Representative sections are placed in formalin at 10:30am.  Summary of Sections: 1A-1B  deep margin closest to mass, 1C  superficial margin closest to mass, 1D-1F  representative sections of primary mass, 1G-1H  representative sections of suspicious breast tissue in lower outer quadrant, 1I  representative section of nipple, 1J  intact axillary lymph nodes. Specimen 2 received in formalin labeled sentinel node are two pieces of fatty tissue each containing a single lymph node.  The smaller node measures 0.8cm in greatest dimension and the larger node measures 1.7cm in greatest dimension.  The nodes are submitted in their entirety separately in cassettes 2A-2B.  **INITIALS\nMicroscopic Description Sections show infiltrating cancer ductal malignant epithelial tumor. The tumor shows low-grade histology with foci of low-grade DCIS. No vascular invasion or marginal involvement is seen. Sections from the separately submitted suspicious area show proliferative fibrofluid-filled sacic changes with prominent intraductal excessive cell growth and papillomatosis. No malignant epithelial tumor is seen.  A few calcifications are seen. The nipple is unremarkable. The three axillary tail lymph nodes show no spread of cancer. The two sentinel lymph nodes are also free of tumor.  MHB/mbc\nAmendments: Electronically Signed Out By **NAME[ZZZ, YYY M]. Procedures/Addenda\n"

There are five lymph nodes identified in the fat\nmeasuring up to 1.0 cm in greatest dimension.  One of the lymph nodes is\nsuspicious for tumor.  The lymph nodes are sectioned, scrape preps made,\nand remainder entirely submitted in blocks A1-A5 to include individual\nsectioned lymph nodes in each cassette.\nFROZEN SECTION DIAGNOSIS   LEFT BREAST SENTINEL LYMPH NODES:  FIVE NODES;\nAT LEAST ONE CONTAINS METASTATIC MALIGNANT EPITHELIAL TUMOR (XX)\nB.   Container designation: \"left breast   The specimen consists of an\noriented (short suture - superior, long suture - lateral), 1060 gram, 22.0\nx 22.0 x 5.0 cm simple left mastectomy surfaced by an unremarkable 27.0 x\n11.5 cm nipple-bearing skin ellipse.  The deep aspect is inked black, the\nanterior aspect is inked blue, and the lateral skin edge is overlaid with\nred ink.  Also, received unattached, separate is a 7.0 x 7.0 x 3.0 cm\naggregate of fat.  There is a 2.6 x 2.4 x 2.2 cm well-circumscribed hard\nmass at 1:00, 9.0 cm from the nipple, and is 0.8 cm from the deep margin\nand >1 cm from the remaining surgical borders.  At the center of the mass, is an\nintraparenchymal metallic marking clip.  There are no other lesions\nidentified and the mastectomy is predominantly fat admixed with a moderate\namount of fibrous tissue (20-25%).  There are no lymph nodes identified at\nthe lateral aspect of the specimen and no lesions underlying the nipple.\nThe separate received aggregate of fat is inked green.  The separate\naggregate of fat contains fibrous bands, but no additional lymph nodes or\nmass lesions.  The remainder of the specimen is unremarkable.  Represented\nin blocks B1-B9 as follows:  B1-B2 tumor, includes closest margin (deep),\nand area of intraparenchymal marking clip; B3 nipple; B4-B7 contains\nfibrous tissue and anterior surgical borders from upper outer, lower outer, lower\ninner, upper inner quadrants, respectively (B4 1:00, 3.0 cm from skin edge,\nB5 5:30, 5.5 cm from skin edge, B6 7:00, 5.0 cm from skin edge, B7 11:00,\n3.5 cm from skin edge).

Container designation: \"3-right breast\"   The specimen consists of an\noriented (short suture   superior, long suture   lateral), 906 gm, 20.0 x\n18.0 x 6.0 cm simple right mastectomy surfaced by 20.0 x 9.0 cm\nnipple-bearing skin ellipse.  Also, received separate is an unattached 6.0\nx 4.0 x 3.0 cm aggregate of lobulated fat.  The deep aspect is inked black,\nthe anterior aspect is inked blue, and the most lateral skin edge is\noverlaid with red ink.  There are no mass lesions identified and the\nspecimen is predominantly fat amidst with a moderate amount of dense,\ngranular fibrous tissue (20-25%).  There are no lymph nodes identified at\nthe lateral aspect of the specimen.  There are no lesions underlying the\nnipple.  The separate aggregate of fat is inked green.  There are no lymph\nnodes or mass lesions identified in the separate received aggregate of fat.\nRepresentative in blocks C1-C10 as follows:  C1-C8 contains fibrous tissue\nand anterior surgical borders from upper outer, lower outer, lower inner, and upper\ninner quadrants, respectively (C1   random, C2   9:30, 3.5 cm from skin\nedge, C3   random, C4   8:00, 4.5 cm from skin edge, C5   random, C6\n5:00, 5.5 cm from skin edge, C7   random, C8   2:00, 4.5 cm from skin edge,\nC9   nipple, C10 representative from aggregate.\nD.

The tumor in other areas shows a somewhat cribriform pattern. In other areas the individual cells, where they appear less cohesive, show large cytoplasmic vacuoles. Microcalcifications are seen within the lesion.  Also noted in the background is a sclerotic papilloma with focal calcifications.  **INITIALS\nAmendments: Amended:  **DATE[Oct 22 2011] by **NAME[XXX WWW VVV] Reason: Immunohistochemical Results      ER/PR Previous Signout Date:  **DATE[Oct 20 2011] Electronically Signed Out By DARON **PLACE Procedures/Addenda Her2Neu **INSTITUTION     Date Ordered:     **DATE[Oct 20 2011]     Status:  Signed Out      Date Complete:     **DATE[Nov 1 2011]     By:  **NAME[UUU TTT]      Date Reported:     **DATE[Nov 1 2011]          Interpretation HER2/CEP17 FISH:       No HER2/Neu gene amplification wash observed for this specimen.

In some cases, it may be helpful to use information about tumor size from imaging studies.  If multiple foci of invasion are present, the size listed is the size of the largest contiguous area of invasion. The size of multiple infiltrating cancer malignant epithelial tumors should not be added together.  The size does not include adjacent DCIS. If there has been a prior core needle tissue sampling or incisional tissue sampling showing a larger area of invasion than in the excisional specimen, the largest dimension of the infiltrating cancer malignant epithelial tumor in the prior specimen should be used for T classification, if known. If there has been prior treatment and no infiltrating cancer malignant epithelial tumor is present, the cancer is classified as Tis if there is residual DCIS and T0 if there is no remaining malignant epithelial tumor.

The skin changes are due to lymphswelling from fluid accumulation caused by tumor emboli within dermal lymphatics, which may or may not be obvious in a small skin tissue sampling.  However, a tissue diagnosis is still necessary to demonstrate an infiltrating cancer malignant epithelial tumor in the underlying breast parenchyma or at least in the dermal lymphatics, as well as to determine biological markers, such as ER, PR, and HER2 status.  Tumor emboli in dermal lymphatics without the clinical skin changes described above do not qualify as inflammatory malignant epithelial tumor.  Locally advanced breast cancers directly invading the dermis or ulcerating the skin without the clinical skin changes and tumor emboli in dermal lymphatics also do not qualify as inflammatory malignant epithelial tumor.  Thus the term inflammatory malignant epithelial tumor should not be applied to neglected locally advanced cancer of the breast presenting late in the course of a patient's disease.  The rare case that exhibits all the features of inflammatory malignant epithelial tumor, but in which skin changes involve less than one-third of the skin, should be classified by the size and extent of the underlying malignant epithelial tumor.  Regional Lymph Nodes (pN) (choose a category based on lymph nodes received with the specimen; immunohistochemistry and/or molecular studies are not required) If internal mammary lymph nodes, infraclavicular nodes, or supraclavicular lymph nodes are included in the specimen, consult the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual1 for additional lymph node categories. Modifier (required only if applicable)      ___ (sn):     Only sentinel node(s) evaluated.  If 6 or more sentinel nodes and/or nonsentinel nodes are removed, this modifier should not be used. Category (pN)      ___ pNX:     Regional lymph nodes cannot be assessed (eg, previously removed, or not removed for pathologic study) __x_ pN0:     No regional lymph node spread of cancer identified histologically      Note: Isolated tumor cell (ITC) clusters are defined as small clusters of cells not greater than 0.2 mm or single tumor cells, or a cluster of fewer than 200 cells in a single histologic cross-section.#   ITCs may be detected by routine histology or by immunohistochemical (IHC) methods.  Nodes containing only ITCs are excluded from the total positive node count for purposes of N classification but should be included in the total number of nodes evaluated.      ___ pN0 (i-):     No regional lymph node metastases histologically, negative IHC ___ pN0 (i+):     Malignant cells in regional lymph node(s) no greater than 0.2 mm and no more than 200 cells (detected by H\\E\\T\\E\\E or IHC including ITC) ___ pN0 (mol-):     No regional lymph node metastases histologically, negative molecular findings (reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction [RT-PCR]) ___ pN0 (mol+):     Positive molecular findings (RT-PCR), but no regional lymph node metastases detected by histology or IHC ___ pN1mi:     Micrometastases (greater than 0.2 mm and/or more than 200 cells, but none greater than 2.0 mm). ___ pN1a:     Metastases in 1 to 3 axillary lymph nodes, at least 1 spread of cancer greater than 2.0 mm ___ pN2a:     Metastases in 4 to 9 axillary lymph nodes (at least 1 tumor deposit greater than 2.0 mm) ___ pN3a:     Metastases in 10 or more axillary lymph nodes (at least 1 tumor deposit greater than 2.0 mm) # Approximately 1000 tumor cells are contained in a 3-dimensional 0.2-mm cluster.  Thus, if more than 200 individual tumor cells are identified as single dispersed tumor cells or as a nearly confluent elliptical or spherical focus in a single histologic section of a lymph node, there is a high probability that more than 1000 cells are present in the node.  In these situations, the node should be classified as containing a microspread of cancer (pN1mi).  Cells in different lymph node cross-sections or longitudinal sections or levels of the block are not added together; the 200 cells must be in a single node profile even if the node has been thinly sectioned into multiple slices.  It is recognized that there is substantial overlap between the upper limit of the ITC and the lower limit of the microspread of cancer categories because of inherent limitations in pathologic nodal evaluation and detection of minimal tumor burden in lymph nodes.  Thus, the threshold of 200 cells in a single cross-section is a guideline to help pathologists distinguish between these 2 categories.  The pathologist should use judgment regarding whether it is likely that the cluster of cells represents a true microspread of cancer or is simply a small group of isolated tumor cells. Distant Metastasis (M)   _x__ Not applicable      ___ cM0(i+):     No clinical or radiographic evidence of distant spread of cancer, but deposits of molecularly or microscopically detected tumor cells

The external surface is yellow-pink, soft and lobulated.  A wire guide is in place.  The specimen is accompanied by radiographs indicating a stellate mass in the center of the specimen with focal calcification. The wire guide appears to pass through the mass.  The external surface is inked blue.  Sectioning reveals a yellow-gray stellate mass in the central aspect measuring 2.2 x 1.7 x 1.2 cm.  Focal tissue death is noted.  The mass has a gritty cut surface consistent with microcalcification.  The mass extends to multiple resection surgical borders.  The remaining cut surface is yellow-pink, soft and lobulated.  A representative section of the stellate mass is submitted for frozen section.  The frozen section remnant is submitted in (block A).  Representative sections of tumor are submitted in (blocks B and C). Representative section of unremarkable breast tissue is submitted in (block D).  Specimen #2 is received in formalin, labeled with the patient's name and designated \"left breast.\"  The specimen consists of a left breast with attached axillary tail.  The breast measures 22.4 x 16.5 x 4.2 cm and weighs 1,031 grams. The attached skin ellipse measures 24.8 x 14.0 cm.  The skin surface is tan-pink with a stapled incision superior of the nipple measuring 5.5 cm in length.  Lateral to the incision is a pink-gray round to oval possible scar measuring 1.0 x 1.0 cm.  Two tan-pink slightly elevated lesions are noted along the superior-medial aspect measuring 0.8 cm in greatest dimension and 0.7 cm in greatest dimension.  The nipple appears unremarkable.  The deep margin is yellow-pink and intact. The deep margin is inked black.  Serial sectioning reveals a recent tissue sampling cavity in the center of the specimen measuring 5.1 x 3.9 x 3.5 cm.  The walls of the cavity are ragged. The tissue surrounding the cavity shows changes of fibrofluid-filled sacic disease.  Biopsy cavity extends to within 1.5 cm of the deep margin.   The axillary tail is dissected and reveals multiple lymph node candidates measuring up to 2.1 cm in greatest dimension.   Representative section of nipple is submitted in (block 2A). Representative sections of skin lesions are submitted in (block 2B). Representative sections of deep margin overlying tissue sampling cavity submitted in (block 2C).  Random sections of tissue sampling cavity are submitted in (blocks 2D through 2F). Representative section of fibrofluid-filled sacic disease is submitted in (block 2G). Random upper outer quadrant submitted in (block 2H). Random lower outer quadrant submitted in (block 2I).  Random upper inner quadrant submitted in (block 2J). Random lower inner quadrant submitted in (block 2K).  Representative sections of lymph nodes are submitted in (blocks 2L and 2M).   **INITIALS\nMicroscopic Description      1.     Sections of tissue sampling of left breast reveals, adjacent to the marker wire, an infiltrating ductal malignant epithelial tumor of breast, grade 2.  The tumor demonstrates a dense desmoplastic stroma with tumor infiltrating the stroma in irregular solid nests, ribbons as well as moderate tubular formation.  Nuclei are moderately enlarged with most showing a distinct nucleolus and stippled to slightly vesicular chromatin pattern.  The tumor demonstrates an intermediate mitotic index with an average of 1 to 2 mitoses per high power field.  Multiple microcalcifications are observed associated with the tumor.  No definitive angiolymphatic invasion by tumor is observed.  Tumor focally abuts against the inked surgical margin of the tissue sampling specimen.   2.     Sections of nipple and areola of mastectomy specimen reveal an unremarkable nipple epidermis showing no evidence of Paget's disease or involvement by tumor.  Subareolar lactiferous ducts are also negative for tumor involvement.  Superficial dermal lymphatics demonstrate no evidence of tumor.  Sections of overlying skin of the breast reveal no evidence of involvement of the epidermis with superficial dermal lymphatics by tumor.  A small seborrheic keratosis is noted.  Also present is an area demonstrating old healed dermal cicatrix.  Sections of the inked deep surgical margin below tissue sampling site reveals a minimum of 1.5 cm of uninvolved fatty breast parenchyma from the inked margin to the site of previous tissue sampling.  Sections of breast tissue surrounding the previous tissue sampling site reveal florid fibrofluid-filled sacic mastopathy including duct ectasia with stasis, fluid-filled sacic duct dilatation with apocrine metaplasia, sclerosing adenosis, blunt duct adenosis, and duct papillomatosis with focal apocrine change.  Multiple microcalcifications are identified associated with fibrofluid-filled sacic mastopathy.  A stellate scar is observed with surrounding complex sclerosing lesion. Adjacent areas of apocrine papillomatosis are identified.  Multiple microcalcifications are observed.  Multiple sections of all adjacent breast quadrants reveal no evidence of additional foci of malignant tumor.  Sections of seven axillary lymph nodes reveal non-cancerous lymph nodes showing no evidence of involvement by primary or metastatic malignant tumor.

Level 3 lymph node, left breast: \nNumber of positive lymph nodes: 0.\nTotal number of lymph nodes examined: 9.\nB. Left breast and axilla: Invasive mammary malignant epithelial tumor with the following characteristics:\n1. Primary tumor size: 4.5 cm.\n2.

Extranodal extension present.\nTotal number of lymph nodes examined: 33 (2 of the 24 lymph nodes in the part B specimen contain isolated tumor cells -- these are not included in the positive lymph node count). \n10. AJCC/ypTN classification: ypT3N3 - stage IIIC, if no distant metastases. \nComment: Much of the tumor consists of fluid-filled sacic spaces lined by neoplastic epithelial cells forming papillary structures. It is difficult, without immunohistochemical stains, to distinguish infiltrating cancer papillary malignant epithelial tumor from intraductal (non-infiltrating cancer) papillary malignant epithelial tumor in some areas. However, much of this appears to be infiltrating cancer neoplasm over the 4.5 cm area of solid to fluid-filled sacic tissue noted grossly.\n \n<PATHOLOGIST>\n**NAME[TTT SSS], M.D.\nAddendum\n<ADDENDUM>\nThe extensive fluid-filled sacic change includes considerable sloughing of epithelial cells, with some areas demonstrating some cell shrinkage and nuclear smudging, which is felt to represent fixation artifact. The majority of the tumor appears viable. There is some scarring process associated with the tumor, but this appears to represent stromal reaction to tumor, rather than fibrous replacement of tumor resulting from drug treatment for cancer.\n \n<PATHOLOGIST>\n**NAME[TTT SSS], M.D.\n**INSTITUTION\n**STREET-ADDRESS                                \nPO Box 50010                                            \n**PLACE, WA **ZIP-CODE                                          **PHONE\n(**PHONE fa\n<CLINICAL INFO>\nLEFT BREAST PAPILLARY MALIGNANT EPITHELIAL TUMOR, METASTATIC TO LEFT AXILLARY LYMPH NODE.

Level 3 lymph node, left breast: \nNumber of positive lymph nodes: 0.\nTotal number of lymph nodes examined: 9.\nB. Left breast and axilla: Invasive mammary malignant epithelial tumor with the following characteristics:\n1. Primary tumor size: 4.5 cm.\n2. Tumor type: Invasive papillary malignant epithelial tumor. \n3. Histologic grade: Intermediate (G2).\nModified Bloom-Richardson Score: 6\nTubular score: 3\nNuclear score: 2\nMitotic score: 1\n4. In situ malignant epithelial tumor: See comment. \n5. Lymphatic/blood vascular invasion: Not identified.\n6. Resection surgical borders: Invasive neoplasm extends to within a fraction of a millimeter of the deep margin of excision (closest margin).\nNeoplasm appears well-away from the other surgical borders of excision. \n7. Estrogen/progesterone receptor and HER-2 studies: Performed on previous tissue sampling (see Laboratories Northwest pathology report ***PATH-NUMBER[1]) and reported as estrogen receptor positive, progesterone receptor negative, and HER-2 negative by immunohistochemistry studies (performed at PhenoPath Laboratories).\n8. Other lesions present: Fibrosis, inflammation, fat tissue death, and hemosiderin deposition - consistent with previous tissue sampling site. \nNegative nipple.\n9. Lymph nodes (including the level 3 lymph nodes from part A, above): \nNumber of positive lymph nodes: 10. Extranodal extension present.\nTotal number of lymph nodes examined: 33 (2 of the 24 lymph nodes in the part B specimen contain isolated tumor cells -- these are not included in the positive lymph node count). \n10. AJCC/ypTN classification: ypT3N3 - stage IIIC, if no distant metastases. \nComment: Much of the tumor consists of fluid-filled sacic spaces lined by neoplastic epithelial cells forming papillary structures. It is difficult, without immunohistochemical stains, to distinguish infiltrating cancer papillary malignant epithelial tumor from intraductal (non-infiltrating cancer) papillary malignant epithelial tumor in some areas. However, much of this appears to be infiltrating cancer neoplasm over the 4.5 cm area of solid to fluid-filled sacic tissue noted grossly.\n \n<PATHOLOGIST>\n**NAME[TTT SSS], M.D.\nAddendum\n<ADDENDUM>\nThe extensive fluid-filled sacic change includes considerable sloughing of epithelial cells, with some areas demonstrating some cell shrinkage and nuclear smudging, which is felt to represent fixation artifact. The majority of the tumor appears viable. There is some scarring process associated with the tumor, but this appears to represent stromal reaction to tumor, rather than fibrous replacement of tumor resulting from drug treatment for cancer.\n \n<PATHOLOGIST>\n**NAME[TTT SSS], M.D.\n**INSTITUTION\n**STREET-ADDRESS                                \nPO Box 50010                                            \n**PLACE, WA **ZIP-CODE                                          **PHONE\n(**PHONE fax\n"

The serosal surface is smooth and glistening.  A fecalith is not identified, however there is a yellow tan area in the lumen measuring up to 0.7 x 0.5 x 0.2 cm and this portion is submitted. Appendix measurement: 7 cm in length x 0.8 cm in diameter Lumen diameter: up to 0.5 cm  Perforation: no The specimen is entirely submitted in A1-A5. ksl/**DATE[May 1 2012] E.A. Pirruccello, DO J.G. Combs\nMICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION      Per the technician who grossed the specimen, the lesion was located about three centimeters from the proximal surgical margin (although an exact measurement was not given).  The margin was not submitted separately, and therefore the true surgical borders cannot be assessed.      A Ki-67 immunohistochemical stain was performed, and is positive in less than 2% of tumor cells.  This case was reviewed at the Intradepartmental Consensus Conference.      The case was discussed with Dr. **NAME[VVV UUU] by Dr. **NAME[WWW] on **DATE[May 7 12].

The specimen consists of five yellow-tan fibroadipose tissue tissue cores, which are each 0.1 cm in diameter, and range in length from 0.6 to 1.5 cm.  The specimen is submitted in toto in single cassette.  The following times are given on the requisition:  S - 11:05 a.m., E - 11:20 a.m., F - 11:10 a.m. on **DATE[Jul 04 2012].  JAB:jck\nMicroscopic Description: Sections of the core tissue sampling demonstrate infiltrating malignant glands set within hyalinized stroma (tubular score: 2) which exhibit mild to moderate nuclear atypia (nuclear score: 2).  Mitotic activity is sparse (mitotic score: 1).  No localized tumor malignant epithelial tumor is seen.  The diagnosis of malignant epithelial tumor is supported by the failure of immunoperoxidase staining for smooth muscle myosin heavy chain and P63 to demonstrate myoepithelial cells.  A few scattered microcalcifications are noted within the tumor. No lymph-vascular space invasion is seen.  The tumor measures up to 0.7 cm in greatest linear extent in this material. A second pathologist has reviewed this case and agrees with the above interpretation.

Segment of terminal ileum in continuity with cecum and ascending colon: \nInvasive glandular cancer \nSpecimen: Terminal ileum, cecum and ascending colon with appendix. \nProcedure: Right hemicolectomy. \nTumor site: Cecum. \nTumor size: 2.5 cm in greatest dimension. \nMacroscopic tumor perforation: Not identified. \nHistologic type: Intestinal, NOS. \nHistologic grade: Moderately differentiated (2/3). \nMicroscopic tumor extension: Through muscularis propria and the pericolonic soft \ntissues. \n\n \n\n<FINAL DX> (Continued) \nMargins: Free (proximal, 7.0 cm; distal, 15.5 cm). \nTreatment effect: Not applicable. \nLymph-vascular invasion: Not identified. \nPerineural invasion: Not identified. \nTumor deposits: Not identified. \nLymph nodes: Ten mesenteric lymph node negative for metastatic malignant tumor (0-10). \nOther: Multiple tubular adenomata; one sessile serrated growth protruding from a mucous membrane. \nAJCC (7th ed.) pathologic stage: pT3 pN0. \nThis case has been subjected to review by a second pathologist per departmental quality \nassurance (QA) policy. \n**INITIALS \n\n<GROSS> \nReceived in two formalin-filled containers labeled '**NAME[BBB, AAA M]. H000730173' and a \nrequisition with '**NAME[BBB, AAA M]. H000730173'. \nThe first is designated 'mesentery small lump' and is a tan-red, firm small lump with attached \nyellow, roughened fat. The small lump measures 2.5 x 1.7 x 1.0 cm. The specimen is inked blue \non the external surface and is quadrisected revealing yellow-brown, granular cut surfaces. \nSectioning and palpation through the remaining fat reveals three tan-yellow, firm small lumps \nmeasuring 0.5, 0.6 and 1.1 cm in greatest dimension. Representative sections submitted in \nfive cassettes. \nSummary of Sections: \nA1-A4 Quadrisected firm large small lump, blue-inked \nA5 Three smaller small lumps found in attached fat \nThe second is designated 'right colon' and consists of a segment of colon with attached \nterminal ileum. The colon measures 20.0 cm in length and up to 8.5 cm in circumference. \nThe terminal ileum measures 6.5 cm in length and up to 3.0 cm in circumference. There is \nattached yellow-red pericolic fat. The serosal surface is smooth and purple. Both ends are \nstapled closed. The proximal margin is inked blue, the distal margin is inked green. \nOpening the colon reveals a well-circumscribed, tan-pink tumor with rolled up borders \nmeasuring 2.5 x 2.5 cm which is 7.0 cm from the proximal margin and 15.5 cm from the distal \nmargin. The fat overlying the tumor is inked black. Sectioning through the tumor reveals \nthat the tumor involves but does not grossly extend through the muscularis propria. The \ntumor abuts the ileocecal valve. The remaining mucosa is soft, tan-pink mucosal folds with \napproximately eight tan-pink possible growth protruding from a mucous membranes ranging from 0.3 to 1.0 cm in greatest \ndimension. These growth protruding from a mucous membranes are found throughout the colon, the closest one approximately 3.5 \ncm from the distal margin. Sectioning and palpation of the attached pericolic fat reveals \n15 possible lymph nodes. The lymph nodes range from 1.1 cm to 0.3 cm in greatest dimension. \nEight lymph nodes are found adjacent to the tumor toward the proximal margin. \nAttached to the cecum is a vermiform appendix measuring 4.0 cm in length and 0.5 cm in \ndiameter. Sectioning reveals a lumen containing light tan, pale-pink fecal material. No \n\n \n\n<GROSS> (Continued) \nfecalith or perforations are grossly identified. \nSummary of Sections: \nB1-B3 Sections of tumor \nB4 Section of tumor showing adjacent mucosa toward proximal margin \nB5 Section of tumor showing adjacent ileocecal valve \nB6-B8 Polyps (B6 contains bisected largest growth protruding from a mucous membrane) \nB9 Representative sections of grossly normal mucosa \nB10 Sections of resection margin \nB11 Appendix \nB12 Bisected lymph node adjacent to tumor \nB13 Bisected lymph node adjacent to tumor \nB14 Two intact nodes adjacent to tumor, one inked blue \nB15 Bisected lymph node adjacent to tumor \nB16 Bisected lymph node adjacent to tumor and one intact node (intact node inked \nblue) \nB17 Trisected lymph node adjacent to tumor \nB18 Four intact lymph nodes away from tumor \nB19 Two intact lymph nodes away from tumor (one node inked blue) \nB20 Bisected lymph node away from tumor \n**INITIALS \n\n<MICROSCOPIC> \nMicroscopic examination supports the final diagnosis.\n"

Specimen 1 consists of:   Pieces:  One   Aggregate dimensions:  0.3 x 0.2 x 0.1 cm.   Cassettes:  One, entirely submitted.   Specimen 2 consists of:   Pieces:  One   Aggregate dimensions:  0.4 x 0.2 x 0.1 cm.   Cassettes:  One, entirely submitted.   Specimen 3 consists of:   Pieces:  Two   Aggregate dimensions:  0.4 x 0.3 x 0.1 cm.   Cassettes:  One, entirely submitted.   Specimen 4 consists of a tan soft growth protruding from a mucous membraneoid tissue fragment measuring   1.0 x 1.0 x 0.8 cm. The surgical surgical borders are inked blue. The specimen   is trisected with fragments upon sectioning and submitted in its   entirety in a single cassette. **INITIALS\nMICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION:   Sections of the first specimen, labeled duodenum, shows small bowel   mucosa with prominent Brunner's glands and a normal villous   architecture with a normal crypt to villous ratio.  The lamina propria   exhibits the normal complement of mononuclear cells.  Focally the   epithelium shows gastric metaplasia.  There is no increase in   intraepithelial lymphocytes and the collagen table is of normal   thickness.  No small area of inflammations or parasites are seen.  There is no evidence   of abnormal cell growth or malignant epithelial tumor.   Sections of the second specimen, labeled gastroesophageal junction,   shows squamous mucosa with reactive changes, including elongation of   papillae and basal zone excessive cell growth.  No eosinophils are seen.  No   glandular epithelium is present.  There is no evidence of abnormal cell growth or   malignant epithelial tumor.  Special stain is negative for fungal organisms and   intestinal mucin with adequate control.   Sections of the third specimen, labeled cecal tumor, shows   desmoplastic and fibrotic stroma infiltrated by irregular angulated   glands and acini composed of cells with enlarged hyperchromatic   irregular atypical round to oval nuclei.  Scattered glands show   luminal dirty tissue death.  The surface appears to be lined by   adenomatous epithelium.   Sections of the fourth specimen, labeled growth protruding from a mucous membrane at 45 cm, shows   growth protruding from a mucous membraneoid fragments of colonic mucosa with a tubular proliferation of   crypts lined by adenomatous epithelium.  There is no evidence of high   grade abnormal cell growth or malignant epithelial tumor.   DICTATION  DIAGNOSIS BY:\nTISSUE SUBMITTED:   1.  Duodenum tissue sampling   2.

        "doc_raw_text": "HISTORY: lung CA right upper lobe into right hilum\nICD9 CODES: 162.3, ,  FISH COMMENTS: Fluorescence localized tumor hybridization (FISH) analysis revealed a normal signal pattern in the cells analyzed.  No break-apart signal pattern, specific for ALK (2p23) rearrangements that occur in t(2;5) and variants, was detected.  However, it should be noted that the FISH probes utilized in this analysis cannot entirely exclude the presence of other chromosomal abnormalities.  Correlation with classic cytogenetics, clinical, flow cytometric, and morphological data is recommended, if available.  FISH analysis was performed in interphase cells using the Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase (ALK) dual color break-apart probe (**INSTITUTION., Des Plaines, IL). MOLEC COMMENTS: Table:  Exon 19 deletion, Increased responsiveness to TKIs, Deletions in exon 19 confer ligand independent activation and increase the duration and activation of receptor signaling after ligand binding. These deletions result in the modified receptors being approximately 100-fold more sensitive than wild-type receptors to inhibition with TKIs.  L858R, Increased responsiveness to TKIs, The missense mutation L858R confers ligand independent activation and increases the duration and activation of receptor signaling after ligand binding. This mutation results in the modified receptors being more sensitive than wild-type receptors to inhibition with TKIs.  G719S, G719A, G719C, Increased responsiveness to TKIs, Mutations at codon 719 in exon 19 are associated with response of NSCLC to gefitinib or erlotinib monotherapy, (slightly more than 50%)  although they are not as responsive as those with deletions in exon 19 or point mutations of codon 858 in exon 21.  S7681, Lack of responsiveness to TKI Mutations at codon 768 in exon 20 are associated with less responsiveness of NSCLC to gefitinib or erlontinib monotherapy.  L861Q, Increased responsiveness to TKIs, The missense mutation L861Q confers ligand independent activation and increases the duration and activation of receptor signaling after ligand binding. This mutation results in a modified receptor that has been reported to be more sensitive than wild-type receptor to inhibition with TKIs.  T790M, Lack of responsiveness to TKIs, T790M point mutation in exon 20 is a frequent cause of secondary resistance to TKIs. It appears that TKI administration may select for a pre-existing T790M resistance clone.  Exon 20 insertion, Lack of responsiveness to TKIs, Insertions in exon 20 have been associated with lack of clinical response of NSCLC to gefitinib or erlontinib monotherapy both in vitro and in patients despite the fact that they seem to activate EGFR to a similar degree as deletions in exon 19 or exon 21 mutations. This is a rare mutation however, and robust clinical data is lacking.  References: (1) **NAME[ZZZ, YYY M]. et al. N Engl J Med 350(21): 2129, 2004. (2) Wu, Jenn-Yu et al. Cl.n Cancer Res **ID-NUM, 2008. (3) Kobayashi, Susumu et al. N Engl J Med **ID-NUM, 2005.    Methodology:  Tumor areas of interest were identified and selectively microdissected from the paraffin-embedded tissue section. The collected cells were lysed, and the genomic DNA was purified from the sample. The DNA yield was determined, and the samples were brought to an optimal concentration. Real-time PCR was used to evaluate specific mutations, deletions and insertions in the tyrosine kinase domain of the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) gene. Eight reactions containing 30 primer and probe sets were used to target specific regions of exons 18-21 as well as the wild-type sequence.   Intended Use:  The EGFR mutation analysis by real-time PCR is able to detect the wild-type sequence and 29 known mutations, deletions and insertions found in exons 18-21 of the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain. The results of this study are to be interpreted in context with other clinical findings in patient care management. The intended use of this assay is to aid the treating physician in the selection of the appropriate therapy for the patient. There is a significant association between EGFR mutation, especially exon 19 deletion, and response to TKI's. This assay is capable of detecting a mutation of 1-5% in a background of wild-type alleles. These mutations are linked to clinical responsiveness to EGFR inhibitors, such as gefitinib (Iressa) and erlotinib (Tarceva).  * An \\\"Alteration Not Detected\\\" result does not preclude the presence of an EGFR mutation since results depend on percent mutant sequences, adequate specimen integrity, absence of inhibitors, and sufficient DNA to be detected.

FISH TECH DATA: nuc ish(ALKx2)[200] MICRO: Lung, right upper lobe bronchoscopic tissue sampling, confirms the clinical suspicion of malignant tumor.  This is squamous malignant epithelial tumor, moderately differentiated in a background of a mixed inflammatory cell population and mucus.  This is consistent with the tumor diathesis of invasion.  The tumor is moderately differentiated.  Molecular pathology, specifically the lung algorithm including EGFR mutation is in process and a supplemental report will follow.

The specimen is received in a Transpec container labeled with the patient's name, number, date and \"left breast.\"  The specimen is accompanied by a mammographic film and is found to contain a localization needle.  The film demonstrates a dense mass, fairly well-delineated lying adjacent to the midportion of the localization needle. The surgical surgical borders are inked beginning with the superior lateral and proceeding in a clockwise fashion with red, green, orange and black.  The deep margin is inked with purple.  The breast tissue is found to contain a 1.2 cm. firm glistening white-tan mass.  Grossly the mass lies approximately 1 cm. or more from all surgical borders except for the superior deep where it lies approximately 5 mm. or less from the inked surface.  The mass and this nearest margin are represented in Blocks A1 and 2.  The breast tissue shows evidence of blue dye discoloration consistent with tracer dye injection.  The nearest surgical borders from the anterior inferior lateral quadrant are placed in Block A3, the anterior superior lateral quadrant margin in Block A4, the anterior inferior medial quadrant in Block A5 and the anterior superior medial quadrant in Block A6. B.    The specimen is received in a container labeled with the patient's name, number, date and \"left axillary sentinel lymph node.\"  The specimen is received in formalin and consists of a portion of lobulated yellow-red tissue, measuring 3 x 1.5 x 1 cm.  The specimen is bisected revealing an encapsulated structure grossly consistent with lymph node.  The outer edge has a peripheral rim of tan-pink tissue while most of the tissue consists of adipose tissue consistent with fatty infiltrate.  No gross evidence of metastatic disease is identified.  The specimen is totally submitted in Block B. C.    The specimen is received in a container labeled with the patient's name, number, date and \"additional superior and deep margin left breast.\"  The specimen is received in formalin and consists of a lobulated portion of yellow adipose tissue, measuring 5.5 x 3.5 x 1 cm.  A surgical suture indicates the new margin.  The new margin is inked and the tissues are serially sectioned and are uniform lobulated yellow glistening throughout.  Multiple full thickness sections are placed in Blocks C1-4. Specimen A BREAST TISSUE WITH MASS GROSSLY CONSISTENT WITH GLANDULAR CANCER CLOSELY APPROXIMATING SUPERIOR DEEP QUADRANT MARGIN. REMAINING SURGICAL BORDERS WIDELY FREE OF TUMOR BY 1 CM. OR MORE. Specimen B LYMPH NODE, NO GROSS EVIDENCE OF METASTATIC MALIGNANT EPITHELIAL TUMOR IDENTIFIED.\nCOMMENT WORD: The left breast lumpectomy **ID-NUM (Specimen A) is found to contain a 1.2 cm. firm glistening white-tan mass.  Microscopically this mass is composed of atypical epithelial cells forming an infiltrating pattern of tubules surrounded by a desmoplastic reaction.  The cells are mildly pleomorphic and the mitotic rate is low.  No vascular infiltration by cancer is identified.  Grossly and microscopically, the neoplasm is noted to extend to within approximately 5 mm. of the superior deep margin.  The remaining surgical borders are widely free of tumor by 1 cm. or more.   The additional superior deep margin submitted as Specimen C shows no evidence of malignant epithelial tumor, therefore, all final surgical borders are felt to be widely free of tumor. There is no evidence of metastatic malignant epithelial tumor in the left axillary sentinel lymph node (Specimen B).  Staging criteria: T1c, N0 probable Stage IA.  Histopathologic grade: tubule formation 1, nuclear pleomorphism 2 and mitotic count 1 for a total score of 4 points, designated as a Grade I, G1 low tumor grade neoplasm.  Histopathologic type: infiltrating cancer ductal malignant epithelial tumor.  The breast tumor profile analysis will be performed and reported separately.\nSpecimen Number: ***PATH-NUMBER[2]. Tissues: A. Left breast - 10-12:00, Lumpectomy, Single stitch superior, double lateral B. Axillary lymph node - Left sentinel C. Left breast - Additional superior deep margin. Specimen Comments:\n"

Fluorescence in\n  situ hybridization for the Her-2/neu gene is then carried out using the FDA-\n  approved Vysis Path Vysion HER-2 DNA probe kit.  The prepared slides are then\n  viewed under a fluorescent microscope with appropriate filters for the\n  chromosome 17 probe (green), the Her-2/neu probe (orange) and DNA (blue) to\n  localize nuclei.  Signals are counted from up to 60 cells and the ratio of\n  Her-2/neu to chromosome 17 signals is computed.

Breast -Left breast core tissue sampling 12:00 / 5 cm from nipple \n<ADDENDUM> \nAddendum 1 Entered: **DATE[Feb 05 12]-0825 \nImmunohistochemical Studies Performed \nB. Left breast, 6:00, MRI-guided needle core tissue sampling: \nInvasive mammary malignant epithelial tumor with the following immunohistochemical features 1. \nEstrogen receptor expression: Positive (59% of cells, moderate staining \nintensity). \n2. Progesterone receptor expression: Positive (2% of cells, strong staining \nintensity). \n3. HER2 oncogene protein overexpression: Negative. \n\n \n<ADDENDUM> (Continued) \nIMMUNOHISTOCHEMICAL RESULTS \nDeparaffinized tissue sections undergo optimized epitope retrieval prior to incubation with \nthe appropriate antibody. Visualization is provided by an immunoperoxidase technique. \nImmunohistochemical staining is evaluated by visual examination of slides using a \nconventional light microscope and by computer-assisted morphometric analysis where noted. \nThe positive and negative control slides for each immunohistochemical test are reviewed and \nfound to exhibit the appropriate staining pattern. Results on the infiltrating cancer malignant epithelial tumor are as \nindicated in the table below \nTests performed on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded block: B1 \nAntibody (clone): Result \nEstrogen receptor (ER) (SP1): 59% *** \nProgesterone receptor (PR) (PgR 636): 2% *** \nHER2 (HerceptTest Dako) 1+ **** \n***Hormone receptor scoring is performed quantitatively by computer-assisted morphometric \nanalysis with an Applied Imaging Ariol system. Results are reported as positive for the \npercentage of neoplastic cells that exhibit the expected staining pattern when the \npercentage is greater than or equal to 1%. Results are reported as negative when the \npercentage of neoplastic cells that exhibit the expected staining pattern is less than 1%. \n****HER2 immunohistochemical slides are prepared with the Dako HercepTest (FDA method) \nfollowing the procedures as outlined in the test kit. Separate 1+, 2+, and 3+ staining \ncontrols are provided for each run. Analysis is performed by quantitative computer-assisted \nmorphometric analysis based on an appropriately trained Ariol (Applied Imaging) system. The \nimmunostained signal is analyzed for each selected area of the infiltrating cancer tumor. The final \nresults are scored according to CAP-ASCO HER2 testing guidelines (Wolff et al., 2007) as \nnegative (either 0 or 1+), equivocal (2+, requiring a calculated signal of at least 2+ in \n>10% of the selected tumor), or positive (3+, requiring a calculated signal of 3+ in >30% of \nthe selected tumor). Validation studies are performed on a set of tumors for which \nimmunohistochemical and fluorescence localized tumor hybridization (FISH) results are known from \noutside studies performed by an external laboratory using validated methods. The validation \nset consists of 97 immunohistochemical results (which includes 33 external 3+ scores and 35 \nexternal negative scores) and 49 FISH results (which consists of 16 positive results and 33 \nnegative results). Comparison of the internal immunohistochemical scores obtained by \ncomputer-assisted morphometric analysis with the external immunohistochemical scores reveals \nno discordance between immunohistochemical internal (negative, 3+) scores and external (3+, \nnegative) scores, respectively. Specifically, identical results are found with all 33 of the \nexternally scored 3+ cases and with 34 of the 35 externally scored negative cases, with one \nof the externally scored negative cases given an internal score of 2+ (equivocal). Cases \npossessing internal scores of negative or 3+ but which are externally scored as 2+ are found \nto possess negative and positive FISH results which are 100% concordant with the internal \nnegative and 3+ immunohistochemical scores, respectively. Comparison of the internal \nimmunohistochemical scores obtained by computer-assisted morphometric analysis with the \nexternal FISH scores reveals no discordance between immunohistochemical (negative, 3+) \nscores and FISH results. Specifically, all 22 internal negative immunohistochemical scores \ncorrespond to negative FISH results and all 14 internal 3+ immunohistochemical scores \ncorrespond to positive FISH results. The remaining 13 FISH results correspond to internal 2+ \nimmunohistochemical scores. \n\n \n<ADDENDUM> (Continued) \nBreast specimens are allowed to fix in 10% neutral buffered formalin for at least 6 hours \nand complete processing within 36 hours of receipt unless otherwise noted. \nThis laboratory participates in external HER2 proficiency testing as specified in the \nCAP-ASCO HER2 testing guidelines (Wolff et al., 2007). \nThe performance characteristics of these immunohistochemical tests have been determined by \n**INSTITUTION.

PATHOLOGIST's COMMENTS  Reviewed for QA (GK). \nGROSS DESCRIPTION  Received fresh designated \"TAH, BSO, abdominal perineal resection\" are two separate specimens in the container; first is a uterus with cervix and bilateral fallopian tubes and ovaries weighing 300 grams.  Also received is an **DATE[Mar] specimen including colon, rectum and anus.  Attached vagina is present anteriorly.  Dr. **NAME[UUU] demonstrated the connection between the two specimens and the anterior portion of the uterus is inked blue for orientation.  The segment of bowel, including anus, measures 45 cm in length.  The proximal portion consists of colon and is closed with a staple line.  The distal end is anus consisting of skin closed with a suture.  The distal portion of the specimen is retroperitoneal. Anteriorly, located 9.0 cm from the distal margin is a 5.2 x 5.2 cm diamond shaped area of attached vagina with staple lines.  It has been somewhat torn but appears to entirely cover the underlying rectum and tumor.  A palpable mass is identified beginning approximately 8 cm from the distal margin with possible thickening of the distal rectal portion for a length of approximately 2.0 cm beginning 3 cm from the anal margin.  The specimen is placed in formalin for fixation and further dictation.  Following fixation, the specimen is re-examined.  The fixed abdominal perineal resection specimen including anus, rectum and sigmoid colon in the fixed state measures 38.0 cm.  The distal 11.4 cm consist of lower rectum and anus which is totally non-peritonealized.  Near the lower end of the peritoneal reflection 12.0 cm from the distal margin, the peritoneum has been torn for a length of 3.5 cm.  As previously described, the anterior rectum is partially covered by an irregular roughly diamond shaped of piece of vagina.  The upper portion of this piece of vaginal wall is torn and contains sutures.  Posteriorly, the peritoneal reflection is identified and the distal 18.0 cm posteriorly are retroperitoneal. The mesorectum is identified posteriorly 7.0 cm from the distal margin of resection and appears intact.  The surgical borders are inked as follows:  anterior deep margin with vaginal mucosa - black; corresponding lower uterine segment and cervix - black; proximal peritoneum - blue; distal adventitia including mesorectum - green. The specimen is opened and the squamocolumnar   junction is 3 cm from the distal margin. The tumor measures 5.5 x 5.0 x 2.4 cm.  It is pink-red and firm, has an irregular shape and it is entirely circumferential in the rectum. It is grossly located above the squamocolumnar junction.  It grossly extends through muscle wall, and possibly to the deep margin.  The distal margin is located 5.5 cm from the tumor. The proximal margin is 25.5 cm from the tumor.  The peritoneal margin is 7.0 cm from the tumor.  Proximal to the squamocolumnar junction the rectal mucosa appears somewhat redundant.

They are submitted as follows: 39.        four small nodes 40.        four small nodes 41.        bisected nodes 42.        one node 43.        one sectioned node 44.        two nodes 45\\T\\46.        largest node sectioned  Received is a round detached uterus with a smooth shiny serosa with a few adhesions.  The uterus measures 9.0 x 7.5 x 5.5 cm.  The cervix is unremarkable and measures 3.5 x 3.0 cm.   It has a 0.3 cm slit-like os.  The os is slightly stenotic.  The ovaries and fallopian tubes are attached.  The uterus is opened to reveal a tan, triangular endometrium measuring 3.5 x 5.0 cm with a maximum endometrial thickness of 0.2 cm.  The myometrium is sectioned and has a maximum thickness of 4.3 cm.  The endocervical canal is unremarkable.  The right ovary and fallopian tube weigh 12.0 grams.  The ovary has a dusky, gray-purple appearance and multiple serosal fluid-filled sacs ranging in size from 0.5 to 1.3 cm in greatest dimension.  They all contain clear fluid and smooth shiny walls.  The ovary measures 2.0 x 2.0 x 1.5 cm.  It is sectioned and the cut surfaces are unremarkable.  The attached fimbriated fallopian tube measures 6.0 cm in length with a diameter ranging in size from 0.5 to 0.7 cm.  The left ovary weighs 18.0 grams.  The ovary has a dusky, purple-blue appearance and measures 1.6 x 1.4 x 1.0 cm.  The ovary is sectioned and the cut surfaces reveal two fluid-filled sacic areas and possible corpora lutea.  The smaller measures 1.3 cm in diameter and the larger measures 1.5 cm in diameter.  The attached fimbriated fallopian tube measures 5.0 cm in length with a diameter ranging in size from 0.4 up to 0.6 cm.

Further sectioning reveals tumor located at the squamocolumnar junction, 3.0 cm from the distal proximal margin.  There is also a possible 5 mm tan-white tumor small lump identified along one cauterized edge of the specimen.  Violet ink is placed on the cauterized surface for identification.  The remaining anus is identified.

ADDITIONALLY, THERE IS A HYPERPLASTIC GROWTH PROTRUDING FROM A MUCOUS MEMBRANE.  PATHOLOGIST's COMMENTS  IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY REPORT  Using appropriate positive and negative controls, sections from the rectal growth protruding from a mucous membranes specimen are submitted for immunoreactive synaptophysin, chromogranin, and CD56 via an immunohistochemical technique.  Tumor cells stain strongly and diffusely positive for synaptophysin and moderately and diffusely positive for CD56.  Tumor cells are negative for chromogranin.  All internal and external controls react appropriately.  INTERPRETATION:  This staining pattern is supportive of a carcinoid tumor.

Sections of the growth protruding from a mucous membrane at lower left colon show multiple fragments of growth protruding from a mucous membraneoid material with tubular adenomatous variety of architecture with some villous transformation appreciated, mild to moderate.  Congestion is present in the stroma. Inflammation is chronic.   No malignant features are seen.  No localized tumor and no infiltrating cancer change is identified. Deeper sections show similar features. Sections of the growth protruding from a mucous membrane at rectum show a tubular adenoma with medium-grade abnormal cell growth.  No localized tumor and no infiltrating cancer change is seen. Some focal areas of mild to moderate abnormal cell growth are present on the surface of this growth protruding from a mucous membraneoid structure.  No localized tumor and no infiltrating cancer malignant epithelial tumor is seen.  Deeper sections show fragments with superficial severe abnormal cell growth.  Carcinoma localized tumor in this fragment of growth protruding from a mucous membraneoid tissue from the rectum is present.  These are one the small fragments near the superficial layer of the mucosa.  Hyperchromatism and irregular nuclear membranes are present with mitotic activity.  No infiltrating cancer features are identified. <Sign Out Dr. **NAME[ZZZ]> **NAME[YYY XXX], M.D, PATHOLOGIST Page 1 of 1\nTISSUE SUBMITTED:  (1) GROWTH PROTRUDING FROM A MUCOUS MEMBRANE, SURGICAL EXCISION Left colon growth protruding from a mucous membranes (2) GROWTH PROTRUDING FROM A MUCOUS MEMBRANE, SURGICAL EXCISION Polyp @ lower left colon (3) GROWTH PROTRUDING FROM A MUCOUS MEMBRANE, SURGICAL EXCISION Polyp @ rectum\n"

At 9:00, there are two foci of infiltrating cancer tumor in a single section\nseparated by tissue sampling-related changes. The greatest overall dimension is 1.8\ncm on a glass slide. Per Dr. **NAME[ZZZ YYY], on MRI there was a clumped\nlesion at 9-10 o'clock, 6.6 to 8 cm from the nipple, and biopsies were\ntaken on either side of the lesion. Given these findings and the histologic\nfindings, a tumor stage of T1c is assigned. The tissue surrounding the\nretroareolar tissue sampling demonstrates atypical lobular excessive cell growth without\ninfiltrating cancer tumor.\nGROSS DESCRIPTION:  Number of specimen containers: 2.  Labeled with name\nand date of birth:  **NAME[BBB, AAA] and **DATE[Dec 20 1960].\nA.   Container designation: \"right breast\" --  Received fresh is a 752\ngrams, 20.7 cm medial to lateral x 14.7 cm superior to inferior x 5.3 cm\nanterior to posterior right breast which is oriented as per requisition\nslip as follows:  clip in axilla.  The breast is surfaced by a 5.3 cm\ndiameter portion of skin which contains an unremarkable nipple and areola.\nThe surgical borders are inked as follows:  superior superficial   blue, inferior\nsuperficial   green, and deep   black.  At the 9:00 position 7.5 cm from\nthe nipple is a 3.0 x 2.5 x 2.2 cm ill-defined apparent tissue sampling cavity with\nareas of focally chalky yellow apparent fat tissue death and no gross evidence\nof tumor.  The apparent tissue sampling cavity comes within 1.2 cm of the\nsuperficial margin and 2.0 cm of the deep margin and has an embedded\nintraparenchymal clip.  There is a second lesion at the 12:00 position in\nthe retroareolar region which consists of a 1.8 x 1.5 x 1.3 cm area of\nnodularity with no gross evidence of tumor.  The nodularity comes within\n2.0 cm of the superficial margin and 4.3 cm of the deep margin and has an\nintraparenchymal clip.  Elsewhere, the cut surfaces have approximately 10%\nfocally blue-dyed fibrous stroma with no additional abnormality.\nCassettes:  representative A1 nipple; A2-A5 tissue sampling cavity at 8:00 position;\nA6 deep margin underlying tissue sampling cavity; A7-A10 nodularity at 1:00\nposition; A11 surgical borders at 1:00 nodularity; A12 upper inner quadrant; A13\nlower inner quadrant; A14 lower outer quadrant; A15 upper outer quadrant.\n(upper outer quadrant 7 cm from the nipple and 5 cm from skin edge, lower\ninner quadrant 4:30 position 7 cm from the nipple and 5 cm from the skin\nedge, lower outer quadrant 6:30 position 7 cm from the nipple and 5.2 cm\nfrom the skin edge, upper outer quadrant 9.0 cm from the nipple and 6.5 cm\nfrom the skin edge).\nINTRAOPERATIVE CONSULTATION   RIGHT BREAST   LESION WITH CLIP IDENTIFIED,\n1.2 cm FROM CLOSEST (ANTERIOR) MARGIN (GROSS ONLY) (XX).\nB.   Container Received fresh is a 4 x 2.5 x 0.5 cm portion of fat which\ncontains six lymph nodes ranging from 0.5 to 1.2 cm in greatest dimension.\nTwo of the lymph nodes are blue-dyed.  A scrape prep of each lymph node is\nobtained on four slides.  The lymph nodes are entirely submitted two per\ncassette with one inked in B1-B3. INTRAOPERATIVE CYTOLOGY DIAGNOSIS   RIGHT\nSENTINEL LYMPH NODES   SIX NODES, NEGATIVE ON SCRAPE PREP (XX).\nC.   Container designation: \"deep margin right breast\" --  The specimen\nconsists of a 3.1 x 1.7 x 0.7 cm breast tissue sampling which is oriented as per\nrequisition slip as follows:  clip right breast towards tumor.  The outer\nsurface is inked as follows:  aspect with clip   blue and remaining outer\nsurface   black.  The cut surfaces are comprised of greater than 95%\nadipose tissue and less than 5% fibrous stroma with no gross abnormality.\nCassettes:  entirely C1-C2.\nD.   Container designation: \"lateral/anterior margin\" --  The specimen\nconsists of a 3.3 x 2.5 x 1.2 cm breast tissue sampling which is oriented as per\nrequisition slip as follows:  clip towards tumor.  The outer surfaces are\ninked as follows:  aspect with clip   blue and remaining outer surface\nblack.

The bilateral vas averages 3.5cm in length and bilateral seminal vesicles average 2.0 x 1.5 x 1.0cm.  The prostate gland is inked as follows:  right lobe  blue, left lobe  black.  The proximal and distal urethral resection surgical borders are taken en face and submitted in their entirety.  The prostate gland is sectioned from the distal toward the proximal aspect to reveal tan, glistening, prostatic parenchyma with numerous tan small lumps which bulge from the cut surface.  The small lumps are in both the right and left lobes and compress the surrounding probe patent urethra.  No single discrete area of tumor is grossly identified.  Representative sections are submitted.  Summary of Sections: A  right vas margin, B  left vas margin, C  distal urethra, D  proximal urethra, E-T  right lobe of prostate submitted every other slice sequentially from the distal toward the proximal aspect, U-JJ  left lobe of prostate submitted every other slice sequentially from the distal toward the proximal aspect.  **INITIALS\nMicroscopic Description The right and left vas surgical borders and the distal and proximal urethra surgical borders are free of tumor.  Multiple sections from the right lobe show involvement with glandular cancer.  The tumor shows infiltrating glands with large hyperchromatic nuclei with some gland fusion.  The tumor infiltrates into the prostatic capsule with focal extraprostatic extension on the right side, but no marginal involvement is seen.  The tumor involves approximately 15% of the right lobe.  The left lobe shows similar tumor involvement with infiltrating glands with some gland fusion.  No extraprostatic extension or marginal involvement is identified on this side.

No overlying skin is identified.  The specimen is received oriented as follows:  \"Short suture superior, long lateral, opening is anterior.\"  The specimen measures 9.7 cm from right lateral to medial pole, 8.5 cm from inferior to superior edge and 6.0 cm from anterior to deep/posterior.  A thick and firm segment of brown-red muscle at the deep margin measures 4.6 x 3.2 x 0.9 cm.  A large and central fenestration on the anterior surface exposes an underlying seroma cavity with a reconstructed measurement of 5.0 x 4.5 x 3.5 cm.  Again, no skin is grossly identified.  The fenestration measures 3.5 x 3.0 cm.  The deep margin is black inked, the anterior rim surrounding the aforementioned fenestration is yellow inked, superior blue, inferior red, medial orange and lateral green.  The specimen is serially sectioned perpendicular to the long axis/transverse plane.\nAt its closest approach the seroma cavity is exposed at the central anterior surface, as previously described.  At its closest approach the seroma cavity is 0.5 cm from the black inked central deep/posterior, 1.8 cm from the red inked inferior, 1.5 cm from the green inked lateral, 0.7 cm from the blue inked superior and 0.7 cm from the orange inked medial.  Immediately adjacent to the seroma cavity has focal firm fat tissue death.  No infiltrating cancer lesion or calcifications are grossly identified.  Representative sequential sections are submitted in 14 cassettes.\nSummary of sections:  1A - seroma cavity with blue inked superior at double short suture; 1B - anterolateral approximately 0.5 cm from  the superior pole; 1C-1D - anteromedial approximately 1.0 cm from the superior pole; 1E - deep/posterior approximately 1.5 cm from superior pole; 1F - orange inked medial approximately 1.5 cm from superior pole; 1G - deep/posterior approximately 2.0 cm from superior pole; 1I - lateral approximately 3.0 cm from superior pole; 1J - anteromedial approximately 3.0 cm from superior pole; 1K - deep/posterior approximately 4.0 cm from superior pole; 1L - anterior approximately 5.0 cm from superior pole; 1M - inferolateral approximately 1.0 cm from inferior pole; 1N - red inked inferior pole.  (**INITIALS **DATE[Jan 7 12])\n\n\n<MICROSCOPIC>\nIn all of the sections except one the changes are non-cancerous.  In 1K representing a deep margin section approximately 4 cm from the superior pole there is a small focus of residual infiltrating cancer malignant tumor.  This is a small focus of infiltrating nests of tumor cells that are small polygonal cells not forming tubules but having only intermediate sized nuclei without significant mitotic activity.  They do not invade vascular spaces.  They do not extend to the deep margin at that point.  Elsewhere post tissue sampling changes are present extensively.  In 1G skeletal muscle is present at the deep margin but not where the tumor was in 1K.  In 1E there is a small fibroadenoma.  No other malignant tumor is evident.\n1K-1: Residual infiltrating cancer malignant epithelial tumor\nR.

The second part received labeled right lower paratracheal lymph nodes contains multiple variably sized fragments of dark brown anthracotic lymph node and associated yellow adipose tissue measuring approximately 2.2 cm in aggregate.  The specimens are entirely frozen as one block. FROZEN SECTION DIAGNOSIS:  Unremarkable lymph nodes and associated fibroadipose tissue perinodal soft tissue; negative for malignant tumor.      (BEW) The frozen material is entirely submitted as B1. The third part received labeled lymph node of right pulmonary artery adjacent to right upper lobe bronchus are multiple fragments of red and tan tissue that are 3-8 mm and are entirely submitted as C1. The fourth part received labeled right upper lobe bronchus is a 1.4 cm fragment of red and tan tissue which is entirely submitted as D1. The fifth part received labeled azygous node are three fragments of red and tan tissue that are 9 mm up to 1.5 cm. The larger fragments are bisected revealing two lymph nodes that are 4 and 5 mm. The specimen is entirely submitted as E1. The sixth part received labeled additional right upper lobe is a 1.1 cm piece of red and tan tissue which is bisected and entirely submitted as F1. The seventh part received labeled right middle lobe are three fragments of red and tan tissue that are 5 mm up to 1.5 cm. The specimens are bisected and entirely submitted as G1. The eighth part received labeled upper bronchus nerve is a 1.5 cm fragment of red and tan tissue which is bisected and entirely submitted as H1. The ninth part received labeled middle lobe node are two fragments of red and tan tissue that are 5 and 7 mm which are each bisected and entirely submitted as I1. The tenth part received labeled right upper lobe is a 143 gram 11.9 x 8.4 x 4.4 cm lobectomy specimen. The pleura is pink and tan. Of note is an area of pleural retraction that is 2.5 cm. This area is marked with ink and the specimen is sectioned revealing a 2.9 cm firm necrotic tan neoplasm which is in direct association with the area of pleural retraction and comes to within 1 mm of the pleural surface. The lesion also comes to within 1.5 cm of the bronchial margin. The remainder of the specimen is unremarkable. There are no grossly identifiable parabronchial lymph nodes. Representative sections of bronchial margin are submitted as J1, lesion and inked pleural surface J2, 3 and 4, and random sections through the remainder of the specimen as J5 The eleventh part received labeled pericardial sac from right atrium off superior vena cava atrial junction is a 2.6 x 2 x 0.3 cm fragment of pink and tan tissue. Representative sections are submitted as K1. (LDA) IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY REPORT Using formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissue with the appropriate positive and negative controls, the specimens designated right lower paratracheal nodes, lymph node right pulmonary artery adjacent to right upper lobe bronchus, right upper lobe bronchus, azygous node, lymph node adjacent to right upper lobe, lymph node right middle lobe, upper bronchus tissue sampling, right middle lobe node (blocks B1, C1, D1, E1, F1, G1, H1, I1) are stained for immunoreactive pankeratin using an automated immunohistochemical technique.  The examined preparations are interpreted as negative; all external controls react appropriately. INTERPRETATION:  Unremarkable lymph nodes and associated perinodal soft tissue without light microscopic and/or immunohistochemical evidence of metastatic squamous cell malignant epithelial tumor.

Container designation: \"right hemi-colon\" --  Received unopened in\nminimal formalin is a contiguous segment of terminal ileum, cecum, and\nascending and portion of transverse colon 30 cm in total length.  The\nterminal ileum measures 7 cm in length.  The proximal and distal bowel\nsurgical borders are approximated by wire sutures and measure 2.5 and 3.0 cm in\nexternal diameter respectively.  The serosa is pink, tan to dusky-gray with\nan area of puckering, 1.5 cm in diameter grossly approaching within 9.0 cm\nof the nearest (distal) resection margin.  This area is inked.  The\nappendix is identified, 4.5 cm in length, 0.7 cm in external diameter and\nopening demonstrates a lumen occupied by loosely formed gray fecal\nmaterial.  The bowel is opened demonstrating a lumen entirely occupied by\nloosely formed green fecal material.  The bowel is remarkable for a\ncircumferential, annular, pink, tan centrally ulcerated mass 3.8 x 2.6 x\n1.4 cm corresponding to the aforementioned area of serosal puckering,\ngrossly approaching within 7.5 cm of the nearest (distal) resection margin.\nSectioning through the mass demonstrates yellow-gray gritty cut surfaces\nwith gross extension through the muscularis grossly approaching within 0.1\ncm of the inked radial margin.  The mucosa of the terminal ileum, cecum,\nand ascending (proximal to the tumor) demonstrates an attenuated dusky-gray\nappearance and the wall ranges from 0.1 to 0.5 cm in thickness.  The mucosa\ndistal to the tumor demonstrates a pink, tan glistening appearance with its\nnormal transverse folds.  No other lesions are grossly identified.\nCassette summary:  A1 representative proximal and distal bowel surgical borders of\nresection.

IHC/a/THM,CLS MER/ap  Electronically Signed Out By **NAME[XXX], M.D.,  MARK E.\nGross Description Received in formalin labeled \"sigmoid colon\" is a 23-cm-long unopened segment of large intestine, having both surgical borders closed with metal sutures and including a moderate amount of partially shredded pericolonic fat.  Located 4.5 cm from one sutured margin, there is a puckered and firm area seen on the serosa.  This area is marked with ink for later identification.  When opened, the specimen is found to contain a metallic mesh stent which begins at the sutured margin near the area of serosal dimpling and extends 10 cm up the lumen from that margin.  The lumen remains patent although the area closest to the margin (in the area of the serosal dimpling) is narrowed to 1.5 cm in diameter.  This is in comparison to an average diameter of 3 cm.  The area of the metallic stent is covered by mucoid material.  Beginning 1.5 cm from the sutured margin associated with the stent, there is a 3.5 x 2.5 x 1.7 cm circumferential area of ulcerated firm tan tissue.  This is suggestive of a neoplasm.  Proximal and distal to the lesion, the mucosa is granular and hyperemic.  This lesional area involves the pericolonic fat and is 3.5 cm from the closest irregular mesenteric soft tissue margin.  The bowel away from the area with the stent shows a few diverticula.  No other mass lesions are seen.  The attached fat is found to contain multiple firm pink tan to gray tan lymph node candidates to 0.8 cm in greatest dimension.  A few of these appear grossly abnormal.  Sections are submitted as follows:  SUMMARY OF SECTIONS: A:  Shave adjacent to sutured margin closest to lesion.  B, C:  Area of serosal dimpling. D through G:  Additional sections through lesional area. H, I:  Additional sections of bowel beneath stent. J:  Representative diverticula. K:  Shave adjacent to sutured margin furthest from lesion. L:  Mesenteric soft tissue margin closest to lesion. M through P:  Intact mesenteric lymph node candidates. NOTE:  A request for a photograph of this specimen has been made by the surgeon.  The pathology department does not have a camera.  The surgery department has been contacted and we have been informed that at present, there is nobody that routinely takes specimen photographs.  The specimen is therefore processed in the usual manner without photography.   LW/USO/MER/ap\nMicroscopic Description Incorporated in diagnosis.

Filling the cecum and involving the ileocecal valve, there is a 10.7 x 9.3 x up to 5.3 cm firm tan neoplastic-appearing lesion, having raised friable and granular edges and a firm central portion.  Within this firm central portion, there is an irregular 4.3 x 4.0 cm full-thickness defect in the bowel wall.  The serosa adjacent to the defect is granular and this area is marked with India ink.  The adjacent appendix is 5.5 cm in length, 0.7cm in diameter.  This appears uninvolved.  The lesion is 5.5 cm from the partially shredded disrupted mesenteric apex margin.  This margin appears uninvolved by tumor.  The bowel distal to the lesion shows two submucosal small lumps of fat which are 1.1 and 1.4 cm in greatest dimension.  These are located 8.5 and 15.7 cm from the unremarkable appearing distal bowel margin.  No other bowel lesions are seen.  The attached fat is found to contain multiple grossly non-cancerous pink tan lymph nodes to 1.7 cm in greatest dimension.  Detached but within the same container is a 6.3 x 2.1 x 1.5 cm irregular piece of intestinal tissue, distorted by black silk and metal sutures.  This shows no lesions.  Sections are submitted as follows:  A:  A shave adjacent to each sutured bowel margin. B:  Ileocecal valve including tumor involvement. C though E:  Tumor with ink on edges of defect. F, G:  Additional representative sections of lesion. H:  Appendix. I, J:  Submucosal masses of fat. K:  Mesenteric apex soft tissue margin. L:  One serially sectioned mesenteric lymph node. M:  One serially sectioned lymph node. N:  One serially sectioned lymph node. O:  One serially sectioned lymph node. P:  One serially sectioned lymph node. Q through U:  Intact mesenteric lymph node candidates. V:  Representative sections, detached piece of intestine. **INITIALS\nMicroscopic Description Incorporated in diagnosis.\n"

In addition, there is dim, partial expression for T-cell markers CD4 and CD7.  There is no significant expression for CD33, myeloperoxidase, or other surface or cytoplasmic antigens associated with T or B-lineage differentiation.  The immunophenotypic findings are consistent with a blast population of myeloid lineage.  \n\nThis test has not been cleared or approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, but the FDA does not require this test to go through premarket FDA review.  **INSTITUTION Pathology Laboratory, which is regulated under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA) as qualified to perform high complexity clinical testing, has developed this test's performance characteristics.  This test should be used for clinical purposes and should not be regarded as investigational or research.\n\nAML FISH PANEL:  NORMAL.\n\nInterphase FISH analysis of at least 200 interphase nuclei per probe was performed with AML specific probe set (**PLACE, IL) to detect abnormalities commonly associated with acute myeloid blood cancer. All FISH signals from all probe sets were within the normal reference range. This represents a NORMAL result indicating the absence of deletion or monosomy of chromosomes 5 and 7; the absence of\ntrisomy for chromosome 8 (i.e., +8), and the absence of any gene rearrangements or translocations involving 11q23, t(8;21), t(15;17), and inv(16).\nResultsComments:\nSee NeoGenomics Laboratories report for additional information.\n"

SPECIMEN SUBMITTED NAME: 1. BAL FLUID, RIGHT UPPER LOBE:  Atypical. 2. BRONCHIAL BRUSHING, RIGHT UPPER LOBE:  Malignant.\nGROSS DESCRIPTION Specimen one is received for frozen section diagnosis labeled \\\"mediastinal mass\\\" and consist of a 0.5 cm thin disc of red soft tissue.  The entire cluster is submitted for frozen section.  The frozen section portion is all of the tissue received and is submitted in one cassette labeled 1FS-1. Specimen two is labeled \\\"right upper lobe tissue sampling\\\" and consists of minute fragments of tiny tan tissue measuring 0.1 to 0.2 cm.  The total cluster measures 0.3 cm. All are submitted in one cassette labeled 2. Specimen three is labeled \\\"right mediastinal lymph node\\\" and consists of two tan-red nodes measuring 0.3 and 0.4 cm.  Both are submitted in one cassette labeled 3. Specimen four is labeled \\\"mediastinal mass\\\" and consists of a red-tan fragment of tissue measuring 0.4 cm and another measuring 0.3 cm and some black tissue measuring 0.1 x 0.3 cm.  All tissue is submitted in one cassette labeled 4.\nMICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION Review of the mediastinal mass, 1FS-1, show a metastatic tumor of epithelial origin, large-cell, non-keratinizing lesion present in bundles and clusters scattered throughout the entire mass submitted for frozen section.  After H\\T\\E staining, sections of the mediastinal mass, 1FS-1, show malignant epithelial tumor in small lumps and clusters within the frozen section portion.  Diffuse involvement of the mediastinal tissue by this tumor is noted.  Permanent section of the frozen section portion shows a malignant metastatic tumor, large-cell epithelial variety, non-keratinizing tumor present. Sections of the right upper lobe lung tissue sampling, 2A-1, show alveolar tissue, dense septal walls and a cellular infiltrate of cells having features compatible with large-cell squamous malignant epithelial tumor with inflammation present.  Desmoplastic response and cells are free within the alveolar spaces.  The cells have large oval nuclei and prominent nucleoli with dense clumped chromatin.  Inflammation is also present. Sections of the right mediastinal lymph node, 3A-1, show more of the mediastinal lymph node architecture with diffuse excessive cell growth in the residual fragments.  A nodular proliferation is noted.  The lymph node structure is sectioned serially and three levels are identified in this one block and is sectioned and no tumor is seen. Sections of the mediastinal mass, 4A-1, show metastatic large-cell, keratinizing, squamous malignant epithelial tumor with irregular clusters and bundles streaming through the mediastinal mass.  Mitotic activity is plentiful. Individual cell keratinization is seen in small cells with keratin production present.  Deeper sections of the mediastinal mass show large cell malignant epithelial tumor scattered throughout with individual cell keratinization.  Keratin pearl formation is present.  Dense pink cytoplasm is present in multiple clusters of this tumor.\nTISSUE SUBMITTED:  (1) MASS, SURGICAL EXCISION Mediastinal mass (2) LUNG, TISSUE SAMPLING, SURGICAL EXCISION Right upper lobe tissue sampling (3) LYMPH NODES, SURGICAL EXCISION Mediastinal lymph node (4) MASS, SURGICAL EXCISION Mediastinal mass\n"

Labeled with name\nand date of birth:  **NAME[BBB, AAA] and **DATE[Mar 09 1962].\nA.   Container designation: \"Meckel's\"   The specimen consists of a 3.0 x\n2.5 x 1.5 cm portion of small bowel with a stapled end and contains (2.7 cm\nfrom stapled end) two pedunculated pouch-like extensions measuring 1.3 x\n1.1 x 1.1 cm and 1.1 x 1.0 x 1.1 cm.  The serosa is diffusely dull and\ncontains focal exudate.  The stapled margin is inked black.  The cut\nsurfaces are unremarkable and both growth protruding from a mucous membraneoid pouch-like extension appears to\nhave three layers and resembles a true diverticulum.  Cassettes:  A1-A2\nboth pouch-like extension.\nB.   Container designation: \"rectum plus sigmoid colon\"   Received fresh\nfor intraoperative consultation is a 16.1 cm designated (stitch proximal\nend per the requisition slip) portion of large bowel with an open and\nstapled ends.  There is a suture on the soft tissue subjacent to the\nstapled end.  The circumference of the bowel ranges from 4.2 cm to 1.0 cm\n(constricted).  The serosa is focally dull and partially disrupted at the\nconstricted site and contains moderate amount of attached fat.  The serosa\nand the closest soft tissue margin at the constricted site is inked black.\nAt the constrictive site within the mucosa there is a 4.0 x 3.5 x 2.5 cm\ncircumferential cavitated thickened mass which is approximately 3.6 cm from\ndistal margin, greater than 5 cm from proximal margin and 5.1 cm from\nproximal soft tissue margin.  The cut surfaces reveal the mass is extending\nthrough the serosa and soft tissue, and may involve the distal and the\nclosest soft tissue margin.  The remaining mucosa does not reveal any\ngrowth protruding from a mucous membranes, diverticula, or any additional masses.  Sectioning through the\nattached fat reveals multiple possible lymph nodes up to 0.5 cm.\nCassettes:  B1   proximal margin (inked blue); B2   distal margin; B3\nclosest soft tissue margin; B4-B9   mass (B4-B5   mass and normal mucosa\ntowards distal end); B10-B11   normal mucosa (B10   normal mucosa adjacent\nto the mass towards proximal end); B12   four possible lymph nodes (one\nbisected and inked red); B13   multiple entire possible lymph nodes; B14\nmultiple entire possible lymph nodes; B15   one possible lymph node.\nINTRAOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS   RECTUM AND SIGMOID COLON:  4 cm GROSSLY CLEAR\nMARGIN DISTALLY.  (XX).\nC.   Container designation: \"small bowel\"   The specimen consists of an\nunoriented, 5.0 cm portion of small bowel with two stapled ends.  The\nserosa appears diffusely dull and contains a small amount of attached fat.\nThe two ends are inked black and blue for differentiation.  The\ncircumference of the specimen averages 3.6 cm and approximately 45% of\nmucosal surface appears erythematous. However, the cut surface does not\nreveal any growth protruding from a mucous membranes, ulcerations, or masses.  Sectioning through the fat\nreveals one conspicuous lymph node (1.0 cm).  Representative tissue - C1-C4\n(C1   margin); C5   lymph node.\nD.   Container designation: \"donut colonic\"   The specimen consists of a\n3.0 x 1.5 x 0.6 cm annular shaped portion of bowel tissue with multiple\nstaples and a suture and is attached to a metallic device.  The specimen is\ninked entirely black and the cut surfaces are unremarkable.  Cassettes:\nsubmitted entirely in D1.\nE.   Container designation: \"rectal donut\"   The specimen consists of a 1.5\nx 1.5 x 0.6 cm annular shaped portion of bowel with staples and is attached\nto a metallic device.

Pathway Anti-HER2 rabbit monoclonal\nantibody, clone 4B5) are carried out on formalin-fixed,\nparaffin-embedded tissue sections.  Positive and negative controls show\nappropriate reactivity. Interpretation of Ventana Pathway for HER2\nimmunostain is performed according to guidelines recommended by ASCO/CAP\nin 2007 (see comment below).  Results are as follows:\nBlock A1\n\nAntibody  Result    Comment\nHER2 0    Negative for overexpression\n\nImpression:\nInterpreted by:  **NAME[VVV M UUU] M.D.\nComment:\n\n1.  The guideline recommendations by ASCO/CAP in 2007 is as follows:  A\nscore of 3+ (positive HER2 test) is defined by uniform intense membrane\nstaining in >30% of tumor cells.  A score of 2+ (equivocal HER2 test) is\ndefined by complete membrane staining that is either nonuniform or weak\nin intensity but with obvious circumferential distribution in at least\n10% of tumor cells, or less commonly, intense complete membrane staining\nbut in only 30% or fewer tumor cells.  A score of 0 or 1+ (negative HER2\ntest) is defined by no or weak and incomplete membrane staining in any\nproportion of tumor cells.\n2.  The correlation between HER2 protein overexpression by\nimmunohistochemistry and HER2/neu gene amplification by fluorescence in\nsitu hybridization (FISH) is not 100%.  Rare cases interpreted as\nnegative (0 and 1+) for HER2 protein overexpression may demonstrate low\nlevel HER2/neu gene amplification by FISH.  Approximately 10-20% of\ncases interpreted as 2+ may show gene amplification by FISH, while the\nvast majority of cases, if not all, interpreted as 3+ show gene\namplification by FISH.  Therefore, additional testing for HER2/neu gene\namplification by fluorescence localized tumor hybridization (FISH) may be\nconsidered on individual cases, if clinically warranted.  Reflexive\ntesting for HER2/neu gene amplification by FISH will be performed on all\ncases interpreted as 2+ (equivocal for protein overexpression) by\nimmunohistochemistry.

ANCILLARY STUDIES (Processed at P\\T\\C Laboratories and reviewed by Dr. **NAME[TTT M. SSS]) CYTOLOGY RESULTS (11-PM-821 / Specimen 1) See separate outside reports SPECIMEN SUBMITTED NAME:  **NAME[DDD] Washing, Left:  Negative for malignant cells.\nGROSS DESCRIPTION Specimen one is received fresh for frozen section labeled \\\"anterior tracheal lymph node\\\" and consists of two fragments of grey tan soft tissue measuring 0.9 x 0.2 and the smaller measuring 0.5 x 0.1 x 0.1 cm.  Both are submitted in one cassette for frozen section as 1FS-1. The previously frozen 1FS-1 is entirely resubmitted as 1FS-1. Specimen two is labeled \\\"anterior tracheal lymph node\\\" and consists of a tan fragment of tissue measuring 0.2 cm and another measuring 0.3 cm and another having a longitudinal segment measurement of 1.5 x 0.3 cm. All three fragments are submitted in cassette 2.\nMICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION Review of sections of the anterior tracheal lymph node, 1FS-1 shows infiltrating cancer large cell malignant epithelial tumor in both fragments submitted.  Features are compatible with a metastatic lesion to this lymph node.   After H\\T\\E staining, sections of the anterior tracheal lymph node, 1FS-1, show metastatic cancer, epithelial in character.  Clusters and bundles of tumor is present.  Permanent section of the anterior tracheal lymph node shows clusters and bundles of a large-cell epidermoid  or squamous malignant epithelial tumor.  No keratinization is identified.  Clusters and bundles are rampant throughout the entire fragmented tissue submitted.  No typical lymph node architecture is appreciated.  Deeper sections of the frozen section show the same features. Sections of the anterior tracheal lymph node, 2A-1, show dense clusters of tumor, large-cell, squamous malignant epithelial tumor variety with infiltrating cancer features rampant.  Poor differentiation is appreciated. No keratinization is identified.  Back-to-back tumor clusters are present in small lumps and bundles.  A deeper section of part two shows similar features throughout.   This is a large cell malignant epithelial tumor, non-keratinizing variety. Primary site unknown.\nTISSUE SUBMITTED:  (1) LYMPH NODES, SURGICAL EXCISION Anterior tracheal lymph node (2) LYMPH NODES, SURGICAL EXCISION Anterior tracheal lymph node\n"

Specicmen E is received labeled distal common bile duct, distal stomach, duodenum, head of pancreas; frozen on bile duct pancreatic surgical borders  FS2A-E. It consist of a single piece of tissue consistent with a Whipple procedure as well as two pink cassettes consistent with frozen specimen. The first is labeled FS2A and the other is FS2B. Both are taken and completely resubmitted. The entirety of the Whipple procedure specimen measures 18.1 x 19.9 x 3.6 cm. The window of the pancreas measures 9.2 x 6.3 x 1.9 cm. The uncinate and some of the remnants of pancreatic head were inked in black and the remainder of the peripancreatic soft tissue is inked in blue. There are two stapled surgical surgical borders, one is a proximal/gastric margin surgical margin and another which is distal/duodenal surgical margin. These surgical borders are sectioned off and these surgical borders are taken and submitted. The uncinate resection area is serially sectioned and radial sections of these areas are taken and submitted.  Sectioning into the pancreatic tumor reveals that it has an approximate measurement of 4.3 x 4.4 x 2.1 cm and it appears to be completely contained within the pancreas. This tumor encircles the common bile duct and does not appear to invade or originate from it. The pancreatic duct is non-patent. The common bile duct is probe patent to the ampulla and the ampulla appears to be uninvolved by the tumor. The bowel wall adjacent to the pancreas was also grossly normal and appears to be uninvolved by the tumor. Sections of the tumor in relation to the ampulla and representative sections of the tumor in relationship to the pancreas are taken and submitted. Representative sections of more normal appearing small bowel and stomach are taken and submitted. The perigastric and peripancreatic fat is serially sectioned and totally submitted for potential lymph nodes.

On **DATE[Jan 01 2012], the patient underwent a craniotomy and resection of the left frontal mass which showed metastatic poorly differentiated malignant epithelial tumor.\n\n<GROSS>\nA.  Received in formalin labeled with the patient's name and per the requisition designated 'endobronchial tissue sampling' are six pale tan-pink tissue fragments ranging from less than 0.1 to 0.1 cm in maximum dimension.  The specimen is sectioned in hematoxylin, wrapped and entirely submitted in one cassette.\n**INITIALS  **DATE[Jan 2 12]\nB.  Designated 'bronchial brushing' is a specimen in two parts.  The first consists of 25 cc of clear fluid in CytoLyt fixative which is used to make a monolayer slide.  Also received are two direct smears fixed in alcohol which are stained with a Pap stain.\nC.  Designated 'bronchial washing' is 25 cc of cloudy orange fluid which is used to make a monolayer slide and a cell block.\n\n<MICROSCOPIC>\nA.  Sections show multiple fragments of bronchial tissue in which the mucosa and submucosa are well represented.  A nonspecific chronic inflammatory infiltrate is present within the submucosa.  No small area of inflammations or neoplastic infiltrates are identified.\nB.  The monolayer slide from the bronchial brushing as well as the direct smears show mostly bronchial epithelium and few inflammatory cells.  No malignant cells are identified.\nC.  The monolayer slide and a section from the cell block show clusters of atypical epithelial cells with enlarged nuclei, multiple nucleoli and moderate cytoplasm.  The cells within the cell clusters exhibit pleomorphism and crowding.  Definite features of malignant tumor are not present.\n**INITIALS  **DATE[Jan 2 12]\n\n\n<FINAL DX>\nA.  ENDOBRONCHIAL TISSUE SAMPLING FROM LEFT SUPERIOR SEGMENT, LEFT UPPER LOBE AND LEFT \n  LOWER LOBE:\n  1.  BRONCHIAL TISSUE WITH MILD NONSPECIFIC CHRONIC INFLAMMATION.\n  2.  NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT TUMOR.\nB.  BRONCHIAL BRUSHING:  NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT TUMOR.\nC.  BRONCHIAL WASHING: \n  ATYPICAL CELLS SUSPICIOUS FOR NON-SMALL CELL MALIGNANT EPITHELIAL TUMOR.\n"

The surrounding perinephric fat is inked black. The kidney hilum is identified and has up to 1 cm of attached renal vein and renal artery and 9 cm of attached ureter. The ureter, renal vein and renal artery resection surgical borders are taken en face. The ureter is probe patent into the kidney pelvis. The renal vein is probe patent with no obstructing masses identified. The kidney is bivalved to reveal a 3.8 x 3.0 x 2.8 cm well-circumscribed golden yellow focally hemorrhagic mass with questionable focal extension outside the renal capsule. The mass is 5.6 cm from the closest black inked perinephric fat resection margin, 11 cm from the ureter resection margin, and 3 cm from the renal vein and renal artery resection margin. The mass is located in the mid to upper pole of the kidney. No involvement of the renal pelvis or renal vein is identified. The remaining kidney parenchyma is red/brown and glistening with a well-delineated corticomedullary junction. The renal pelvis is lined by tan glistening urothelium. There is a smooth-walled fluid-filled sac identified in the upper pole of the kidney. The adrenal gland is present in the upper aspect and measures 2.0 x 1.5 x 1.5 cm. Sectioning through the adrenal gland reveals a golden yellow cut surface. No masses or suspicious small lumps are appreciated. No lymph nodes are identified around the hilum. Representative sections are submitted. Summary of sections: A  frozen section residue; B  ureter, renal vein and renal artery resection surgical borders; C-F  mass to include adjacent vasculature and renal pelvis; G-H  possible extension into perinephric fat; I  fluid-filled sac; J  adrenal gland. **INITIALS\nMicroscopic Description The ureter, renal vein, and renal artery surgical borders are all free of tumor. The tumor shows sheets of malignant cells with markedly pleomorphic nuclei and moderate pink granular cytoplasm. Tumor shows some minimal infiltrative characteristics within the adjacent non-cancerous kidney. No vascular space invasion is seen. No extension into the surrounding adipose tissue is seen. The adrenal gland shows no tumor involvement. The fluid-filled sacic area shows no definite lining. A single lymph node is seen in the perirenal area that is replaced by tumor but shows no extracapsular extension.   To further clarify the chromophobe histology a number of immunostains are performed.  All controls stain appropriately including external positive, internal negative and external negative controls as required.  The tumor is positive for EMA, e cadherin, and pankeratin, but negative for vimentin.  The staining pattern is consistent with a chromophobe subtype.  **INITIALS\nAmendments: Electronically Signed Out By **NAME[YYY, XXX M].

This real time PCR assay has been\nvalidated to identify the most common EGFR tyrosine kinase domain mutations\nthat involve exons 18-21. This test is validated for non-small cell lung\nmalignant epithelial tumor. The clinical significance and use of this assay in other tumor\ntypes is not well characterized. Note that this assay is not intended to\ndiagnose any particular type of cancer, but as an aid to clinicians, is\nintended to be used as an adjunct to other prognostic factors to select\neligible patients for therapy. (**NAME[ZZZ:YYY] et al., NEJM 2004;**ID-NUM, Mok\net al., NEJM 2009; **ID-NUM, Pao et al., JClinOnc 2005; **ID-NUM).\nMATERIAL RECEIVED\nA1 = ***PATH-NUMBER[1], 1 Block (**DATE[May 29 2012])\nPROCEDURE DATE\n**DATE[May 22 2012]\nCLIENT REQUEST / CLINICAL HISTORY\nEGFR by PCR \nEGFR PCR METHODS\nThis real time PCR test (Qiagen/DxS) detects the most common activating\nmutations in EGFR, which have been identified in human lung non-small cell\ncancer involving codons 18-21, and leading to the following types of\nmutations: exon 19 deletions (detects any of 19 deletions but does not\ndistinguish between the types), L858R, L861Q, G719X (detects G719S, G719A, and\nG719C, but does not distinguish between the types), S768I, and exon 20\ninsertions (detects any of 3 insertions but does not distinguish between the\ntypes). These mutations account for the vast majority of all activating EGFR\nmutations. Using control materials that contain the L858R and exon 19\ndeletions, which account for ~86% of known EGFR activating mutations, this\nassay has been validated to detect these mutations at a level of 1%. Purified\ngenomic DNA is extracted from microdissected tumor specimen, is analyzed by\nlow volume spectrophotometry, and then used as sample DNA in a real time PCR\nassay using fluorescently labeled and non-labeled primers to detect wild-type\nand mutated EGFR. Sample delta Ct values for mutant and control reactions are\ncalculated and compared against threshold delta Ct values in each mutant\nreaction to determine the presence of each individual mutation type. Negative\nand positive controls are assayed with each sample. The assay sensitivity is\nestimated to be ~1% tumor involvement for each mutation type detected. \nMETHOD LIMITATIONS: Tumor samples are non-homogeneous and data from a sample\nof tumor may not be concordant with data from other sections of the same\ntumor. Tumor samples may also contain non-tumor tissue, and DNA from these\nareas would not be expected to contain a EGFR mutation. Although this assay\nproduces short PCR products, it may not work on heavily fragmented DNA. In\ninstances where the frequency of a target mutation is very low with respect to\nthe wild-type background (<1%), this assay may fail to detect the mutation,\nleading to a false-negative result.     \n    Electronically signed **DATE[Jun 04 2012]: \n**NAME[XXX WWW], MD-Pathologist, IHC Fellow, Pathologist\nPer CMS regulations, the pathologist's signature above indicates that this\ncase has been reviewed and the diagnosis made or confirmed by said\npathologist.\nNote: Some of the tests reported here may have been developed and performance\ncharacteristics determined by PhenoPath Laboratories. They have not been\ncleared or approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). However,\nthe FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary.\nPursuant to the requirements of CLIA, this laboratory has established and\nverified the accuracy and precision of all tests, and additional information\nabout these tests is available upon request.

PATHOLOGIST's COMMENTS  See Microscopic Description  \nGROSS DESCRIPTION  Received fresh labeled \"left breast mass\" is an 11.5 gram oriented portion of yellow, lobulated, partially disrupted adipose tissue measuring 4.1 x 3.8 x 1.8 cm (medial to lateral, anterior to posterior, superior to inferior).  A short suture denotes superior and a long suture denotes lateral per requisition.  There is a penetrating needle localization wire near one of the partially disrupted area at the anterior aspect.  The specimen is inked as follows:  superior - blue, inferior - green, medial - orange, lateral - violet, anterior - red and posterior - black. /pb/kb  Sectioning of the tissue reveals yellow lobulated glistening cut surfaces.  There is a 1.1 x 0.8 x 0.3 cm hemorrhagic cavity possibly representing a prior tissue sampling site.  The cavity is focally surrounded by pink tan fibrous tissue.  The fibrous areas are within 0.2 cm of the anterior resection margin.  The specimen is sequentially submitted entirely as follows:  1.  perpendicular sections of deep margin 2-7.  one whole cross section in each cassette with cassettes 5 through 7 containing the fibrous areas 8.  remainder of anterior margin 9.  remainder of medial margin  Time received in Lab - 11:39 Time placed in formalin - 11:40 Time sectioned and replaced in formalin - 2:00  The specimen is accompanied by a radiograph            /pb/as \nMICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION  Sections show the site of previous breast tissue sampling showing scarring process with fat tissue death and chronic inflammation.

Numerous plasma cells are within stroma.  Only rare mitotic\nactivity is seen.  The majority of the tumor is nodular and\nwell-circumscribed but infiltrative tubules are seen at the base of tumor.\nThese findings are of an apocrine tumor that is most consistent with a\nsyringofluid-filled sacadenoma papilliferum but the infiltrative border is concerning\nfor the development of second tumor (such as a tubular adenoma or eccrine\npapillary adenoma) or possibly malignant transformation.  Therefore,\ncomplete excision is recommended as the lesion is transected at a\nperipheral margin.  This case was reviewed at the Department Consensus\nConference.\n\nINTRAOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:\nFSA.

Container designation: \"uterus, ovaries, fibroma\" --  Received fresh\nis a 235.5 gram specimen including an unopened uterus measuring 9.5 x 8.5 x\n6.0 cm, right fallopian tube measuring 5.5 cm with a diameter of 0.3 cm,\nleft fallopian tube measuring 7.5 cm with a diameter of 0.3 cm, left ovary\nmeasuring 4. x 3.0 x 1.5 cm, right ovary measuring 2.5 x 2.0x 1.0 cm.\nPlease note that the left ovary is fluctuant and is opened to reveal clear\nwatery fluid and a simple fluid-filled sacic lining.  The exocervix measures 1.5 x 1.3\ncm covered with glistening white mucosa.  The external os is circular and\nmeasures 0.4 cm in diameter and the endocervical canal 4.4 cm in length.\nThe endometrial cavity measures 5.5 cm cornu to cornu.  There is a\ntan-white intramural whorled small lump measuring 5.0 x 4.5 x 4.0 cm that\ngrossly distorts the endometrial cavity.  This small lump is sectioned to\nreveal tan-white whorled areas without apparent tissue death, bleeding or\ncalcifications.  There is a 2.3 x 1.5 cm anterior heaped up gray mass that\ndoes not appear to grossly invade the myometrium.  A 2.9 x 1.8 cm posterior\ntan-gray heaped up mass in the posterior uterus that also does not appear\nto grossly invade the endometrium.  There is possible adenomyosis noted\nthroughout the myometrium.  Myometrial thickness measures 2.5 cm in maximal\nthickness.  The serosa is smooth and glistening without noted adhesions.\nThe fallopian tubes are patent and have fimbriated ends.  The right ovary\nis white with a smooth outer surface.  The left ovary is white, fluctuant\nand opened to reveal simple fluid-filled sacs with serous fluid.

There is some squamous metaplasia with mild atypia at the bronchial margin, however.  The tumor is very close to the bronchial margin, as the subsequent section shows infiltrating cancer tumor within the bronchial wall.  Permanent sections confirm the frozen section diagnoses.

Final Signout: **NAME[XXX WWW], MD **DATE[Oct 23 12]\nFINAL DIAGNOSIS: LEFT ILIAC WING, TISSUE SAMPLING METASTATIC POORLY DIFFERENTIATED MALIGNANT EPITHELIAL TUMOR, SEE COMMENT.\nGROSS DESCRIPTION: The specimen is received in a container labeled with the patient's name, number, date and \\\"left iliac tissue sampling.\\\"  The specimen is received in formalin and consists of multiple longitudinal, cylindrically-shaped portion of glistening tan-white material, measuring 1 x < 0.1 cm. in aggregate.  The specimen is totally submitted in one block.\nCOMMENT WORD: Sections of the left iliac wing tissue sampling show the presence of a non-small cell type malignant epithelial tumor, present in organoid sheets and nests with a faint pseudoglandular appearance.  The cells are large with abundant cytoplasm and centrally located ovoid nuclei with vesicular chromatin and prominent central nucleoli.  No attempts at keratinization are identified.  Tumor infiltrates within fibrous tissue and adjacent skeletal muscle fragments.  Tumor cells stain negatively with Napsin, TTF-1, and p63.  Although this does not exclude a lung primary, it makes it less likely.  Further immunostains are pending to include Mart-1 and S-100 and a separate report will follow.\nSpecimen Number: ***PATH-NUMBER[1]. Tissues: Ilium. Specimen Comments:\n"

SURGICAL SURGICAL BORDERS: NOT INVOLVED. PATHOLOGIC CLASSIFICATION OF CANCER EXTENT:  pT2, N0, MX.. Final Signout: **NAME[XXX WWW], MD **DATE[Feb 30 12]\nGROSS DESCRIPTION: The specimen is received within formalin in one container labeled right colon with terminal ileum and consists of a right hemi-colectomy specimen, as follows:  There is a segment of terminal ileum that measures 6 cm. in length x 4 cm. in circumference, and a segment of right colon that measures 19 cm. in length x 8 cm. in circumference.  When opening, there is a large growth protruding from a mucous membraneoid-fungating tumor mass at the cecum which extensively involves the ileocecal valve and measures 6.2 x 5.5 x 2 cm. The mass, on sectioning, is fragile, easily detaches from the underlying colonic mucosa and does not appear to invade the colonic wall.  The remaining mucosa shows no additional lesion.  Also, the appendix is present and measures 7.5 cm. in length x 0.5 cm. in diameter.  On sectioning, it is unremarkable.  Representative sections are submitted in twenty cassettes - from \"A\" through \"T\", as follows:  \"A\" - proximal and distal margin; \"B\" through \"O\" - growth protruding from a mucous membraneoid mass entirely submitted; \"P\" - appendix; \"Q\" - one lymph node bisected; \"R\", \"S\", \"T\" - multiple lymph nodes in each cassette.\nTissues: COLON SEG RESECT. Specimen Comments: CPT CODES: 88309 x 1\n"

The central portion of the specimen is narrowed.  On section, a 2 x 1 cm ulceration is centrally identified with wide proximal and distal surgical borders.  On section, the wall is thickened and scarring process extends into the peri-colic fat.  Representative sections of ulcer are submitted in cassettes 1 through 5.  The tumor is between 4 to 5 cm from the distal and proximal surgical borders of resection.  A representative section of each margin is submitted in cassette 6.  Possible lymph nodes are submitted through cassette 13.\nMicroscopicDescription:\nSigmoid colon:  Sections demonstrate an infiltrating cancer glandular cancer.  Complex glands invade through the muscularis into the peri-colic fat.  Solid tumor areas are noted with bizarre tumor cells. Solid areas of tumor are felt to represent less than 50% of tumor mass.  1 of 17 regional nodes demonstrates evidence of metastatic malignant epithelial tumor.  In this particular node, the node is located in the immediate peri-colic fat and the tumor is less 2 mm in dimension.  Peri-vascular tumor invasion is noted.  Perineural invasion is also appreciated.   The surgical surgical borders are free of tumor.\nA: Sigmoid colon\n"

Submitted fresh specimen A is labeled LEFT KIDNEY PARENCHYMA FS and consists of two pieces of yellow maroon tissue measuring 2.0 x 0.5 x 0.4 cm.  The resubmitted frozen section tissue is totally embedded in cassette A. B.     Submitted in formalin specimen B is labeled COLON and consists of a colon segment 73 cm in length x a diameter ranging from 2.5 up to 3.5 cm. The serosal area is light tan  pink maroon with a small area of serosal scarring process.  Opening the colon displays an ulcerating and growth protruding from a mucous membraneoid circumferential mass measuring 3.5 x 3.5 x 1.5 cm and extends to within 4.5 cm of the nearest margin.  Prior to sectioning of the mass the serosal margin is inked in black.    Sections display the mass to extend through the muscularis propria and focally into pericolonic adipose tissue.  On the antimesenteric side the tumor appears to focally extend to the subserosa without definitive serosal involvment.  The remaining colon displays approximately the five small growth protruding from a mucous membranes ranging from 0.3 up to 0.5 cm in greatest dimension.  In addition a central mucosal area with green discoloration is identified measuring 0.9 cm in dimension.  Small diverticula are also grossly seen.  No additional masses are grossly identified.  An additional portion of omentum is identified in the specimen container measuring 19.5 x 8.0 x 1.5 cm.  Sectioning shows no gross abnormalities.    Sections of the tumor mass are submitted in cassettes B1  B4, a section of the nearest margin is submitted in cassette B5, sections of the additional mucosal growth protruding from a mucous membranes are submitted in cassette B6, sections of diverticula and green gangrenous area are submitted in cassette B7, section of omentum is submitted in cassette B8, three possible lymph nodes are submitted in cassette B9, a single piece of fibroadipose tissue with associated vascular structures and possible positive lymph nodes is submitted in cassette B10, and additional possible lymph nodes are submitted in cassettes B11- B14. C.     Submitted in formalin specimen C is labeled COLON GROWTH PROTRUDING FROM A MUCOUS MEMBRANE and consists of a large mucosal growth protruding from a mucous membrane measuring 2.5 x 2.4 x 2.3 cm. Sectioning shows a friable growth protruding from a mucous membrane without definitive evidence of gross invasion.  Specimen is totally embedded in cassettes C1  C4. D.

GAR Intraoperative Consultation(s) Frozen section diagnosis: A. Adipose tissue with scarring process, inflammation and histiocytes.  Negative for malignant tumor. (GAR).\nMicroscopic Description A.          Permanent sections of the resubmitted frozen section tissue shows adipose tissue with areas of fat tissue death, scarring process, mild to moderate acute and chronic inflammation with hemosiderin ladened macrophages and associated blood.  No evidence of malignant tumor is seen. B.     Sections of the submitted colon tumor shows irregular tortuous, fluid-filled sacically dilated and cribriforming malignant glands showing significant nuclear pleomorphism with enlarged vesicular nuclei showing occasional inconspicuous nucleoli, minimal pseudostratification and areas of central tissue death consistent with a moderately differentiated glandular cancer.  The tumor is seen extending through the muscularis propria and into the pericolonic adipose tissue and elicits a minimal to moderate lymphocytic response.  Occasional areas suspicious for vascular infiltration by cancer are seen.  The serosal surgical borders are free of involvement. A section of the nearest proximal margin is negative for malignant tumor.  Sections of the additional mucosal growth protruding from a mucous membranes display additional tubular adenomas with mild abnormal cell growth and hyperplastic growth protruding from a mucous membranes.  No evidence of additional evidence of malignant tumor is seen.  Sections of the diverticuli display a single diverticulus with associated adipose tissue showing a non-cancerous lymphoid aggregate.  Additionally, an area of green discoloration shows associated tissue death with significant acute inflammation, swelling from fluid accumulation and muscularis degeneration.  No evidence of malignant tumor is seen. A section of the omentum shows no significant histopathologic abnormalities.  Sections of the submitted lymph nodes display the palpable lymph node to be replaced by malignant glands consistent with metastatic colonic glandular cancer. Sections of the remaining lymph nodes display an additional twelve lymph nodes negative for metastatic malignant epithelial tumor. C.     Sections of the totally embedded mucosal growth protruding from a mucous membranes show the growth protruding from a mucous membrane to display a tubular and villous architectural pattern with surface epithelium showing nuclear hyperchromasia, pseudostratification and moderate loss of basal nuclear orientation.  Mild stroma swelling from fluid accumulation with chronic inflammatory cells is seen.  No evidence of infiltrating cancer malignant tumor is seen.

NEGATIVE FOR PAPILLARY MALIGNANT EPITHELIAL TUMOR.\nGROSS: Received un-fixed for frozen section designated \\\"left thyroid and isthmus\\\" is a 14-gram portion of red-tan thyroid tissue containing a large small lump.  The specimen measures 4.6 x 2.5 x 3.1 cm.  The small lump measures 4.3 x 2.3 x 2.0 cm.  The surgical removal of tissue surgical borders are inked.  The external surface is red and smooth.  Sections through the gland show a well circumscribed, tan small lump with a partial definite capsule.  The small lump has a granular, yellow tan cut surface.  Scrape preps are prepared.  A representative portion is submitted for frozen section in cassette FS.  FROZEN SECTION DIAGNOSIS:  PAPILLARY MALIGNANT EPITHELIAL TUMOR.  Results called to Dr. **NAME[YYY] on **DATE[Nov 05 11] at 2:00 p.m.  Additional sections of the tumor are submitted in cassettes A thru F.  DT: **DATE[Nov 05 11]  Part 2 is received in formalin designated \\\"right thyroid gland\\\" is a lobe of tan thyroid tissue weighing 6 grams and measuring 4.5 x 1.7 x 1.7 cm.  The surgical removal of tissue surgical borders are inked.  The cut surface is homogeneous, red and tan.  The entire lobe is submitted in cassettes #2A thru #2F.  DT: **DATE[Nov 06 11]\nMICRO: Sections from the left lobe of the gland show a partially encapsulated 4.3 cm focus of papillary malignant epithelial tumor.  The tumor is limited to the thyroid gland and does not involve the surgical removal of tissue surgical borders.  The tumor is composed of complex, branching, and randomly oriented papillae with a lining of cuboidal cells.  The nuclear features of papillary malignant epithelial tumor are present.  A few cells demonstrate nuclear grooves and many cells demonstrate ground glass nuclei.  Psammoma bodies are also present.  A single normal parathyroid gland is identified.DT: **DATE[Nov 06 11] (DRB, bsp)  Sections from the right lobe of the thyroid show a well-circumscribed follicular small lump with a fibrous capsule.  This small lump most likely represents a follicular adenoma. Sections adjacent to the small lump show non-cancerous thyroid parenchyma with focal chronic inflammation.  There is no evidence of papillary malignant epithelial tumor or follicular malignant epithelial tumor in the right thyroid lobe.  DT: **DATE[Nov 07 11] (DRB, bsp)\nPROCEDURE: Total thyroidectomy. SPECIMEN(S): 1) Left thyroid and isthmus.  2) Right thyroid.\n"

The core tissue sampling has groups of atypical cells arranged in\nglandular configurations, with hyperchromatic vesicular enlarged nuclei.\nThe background is fibrotic and has a lymphoid infiltrate.\n\nIMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY STUDY:\nDeparaffinized sections of formalin-fixed tissue and the appropriate\ncontrols are incubated with a panel of antibodies or a specific\nfluorescein-labeled (oligo)nucleotide probe.  Localization is via one or\nall of the following three systems: Alkaline Phosphatase multimer-based\nmethod, indirect biotin streptavidin immunoperoxidase method, and biotin\nfree multimer immunoperoxidase method.

This real time\nPCR assay has been validated to identify the most common EGFR tyrosine\nkinase domain mutations that involve exons 18-21. This test is validated\nfor non-small cell lung malignant epithelial tumor. The clinical significance and use of\nthis assay in other tumor types is not well characterized. Note that\nthis assay is not intended to diagnose any particular type of cancer,\nbut as an aid to clinicians, is intended to be used as an adjunct to\nother prognostic factors to select eligible patients for therapy.

Addendum Comment Since issuing the initial report we have stained the infiltrating cancer component of tumor with P16 which is negative.  The overlying squamous epithelium shows patchy weak to moderate staining which is not identifying disease and the infiltrating cancer malignant epithelial tumor is completely negative. This militates against the tumor being HPV related. The immunohistochemical test(s) were developed and the performance characteristics determined by the **INSTITUTION Pathology.  It has not been cleared or approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.  The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary.  This test is used for clinical purposes.  It should not be regarded as investigational or for research.

This\nimmunophenotype and limited morphologic findings are characteristic for\nCLL, or small lymphocytic lymphoma (with hematologic involvement if there\nis predominant lymphadenopathy). The absence of CD38 expression in CLL is\nassociated with better outcome. Cytogenetic analysis is pending.  Please\nsee separate report.\n\nThis test was developed and its performance characteristics determined by\nXXXXX. It has not been cleared or approved by the\nU.S. Food and Drug Administration.

The morphological findings and\nimmunophenotyping are most consistent with chronic lymphocytic blood cancer/\nsmall lymphocytic lymphoma. Some erythroid precursors show slight\nmegaloblastic change.  No other significant dysplastic features are\nidentified.  The morphological findings are insufficient for diagnosis of\nmyeloabnormal cell growth.

The staple line measures \n8 cm.  The pleural surfaces are inked black.  \n\nSections reveal a tan-white and firm circumscribed small lump measuring up to 2 cm in greatest dimension, and is within less than 0.5 cm from the nearest staple line.  Upon removal of staple line, the tumor is immediately adjacent and identified at the margin.  Adjacent sections are tan-gray with black tumor tissues, which grossly appears to be at the resection margin.  The mass does not appear to be grossly involving the pleural surface, however there appears to a torn or lacerated area adjacent the tumor.  The pleural parenchyma adjacent to the mass is predominantly tan-red and soft with scattered gray pigmentation.  No other firm masses or circumscribed lesions noted.  \n\nA representative section of the small lump is submitted for frozen section in one cassette.  All tumor sections submitted in cassettes A1 - A7, with the section of tumor nearest staple line in cassette A4.  Random sections in cassettes A8 - A10.\n\n(B)  Received in formalin labeled \"level 9 lymph node\" is a tan-red, brown and soft tissue fragment measuring 0.9 x 0.7 x 0.5 cm.  All in one cassette.\n\n(C)  Received in formalin labeled \"level 10 lymph node\" is a tan-red, brown and soft tissue fragment measuring 1.1 x 0.7 x 0.5 cm.  All in one cassette.\n\n(D)  Received fresh labeled \"level 10 lymph node\" is a 1 x 0.5 x 0.3 cm tan-red, brown and soft tissue fragment.  The specimen is bisected and submitted entirely for frozen section in one cassette.\n\n(E)  Received fresh labeled \"right lower lobe (for bronchial margin)\" is a lung lobectomy specimen measuring 18 x 10 x 3 cm.  There are three staple lines measuring up to 12 cm.  The pleural surfaces are purple-red with scattered black and white pigmentation.  The surfaces are generally smooth.  On one edge of the lobe is a tan-white and soft unremarkable pleural parenchyma measuring 7 x 1.5 cm.  The stapled resection surgical borders are inked black.  Sections reveal a predominantly maroon-red and soft pleural parenchyma with scattered gray-black and white spicules.  Areas along the staple line are predominantly dark maroon-red and homogeneous.  No circumscribed masses or lesions noted.  \n\nThe bronchial surgical borders appear grossly unremarkable.  \n\nRepresentative sections are submitted in eleven cassettes, with the bronchial margin submitted for frozen section in cassette EFS.  Random sections from staple line in cassettes E1 and E2, random pleural parenchyma E3 - E9, and sections from bronchial margin in cassette E10. \n\n(F)  Received in formalin labeled \"4R lymph node\" are two red-brown, black and soft tissue fragments measuring 0.6 x 0.5 x 0.3 cm and 1.4 x 0.8 x 0.5 cm.  The large fragment is bisected.  Submitted entirely in one cassette.\n\n(G)  Received in formalin labeled \"level 7 lymph node\" is a red-brown, black and soft tissue fragment measuring 1.3 x 0.7 x 0.5 cm.  All in one cassette.\nMicroscopicDescription:\nA - G.

All internal and external controls were appropriately reactive.\nThe steroid receptor result is positive if at least 1% of tumor cell nuclei\nshow specific staining. For positive cases the \"fraction of cells staining\"\nis a visual estimate subject to observer variation. Her2 membrane\npositivity was scored according to **NAME[ZZZ] ASCP/CAP consensus (J Clin Oncol\n25:188, 2007):  0-1+ is negative for overexpression, 2+ is equivocal, and\n3+ is positive.\nGROSS DESCRIPTION:  Number of specimen containers: 4.  Labeled with name\nand date of birth:  **NAME[AAA BBB] and **DATE[Oct 22 1958]\nA.   Container designation: \"left breast\" --  The specimen consists of a 66\ngram, simple mastectomy specimen measuring 14.2 x 7.3 x up to 1.8 cm,\npartially surfaced with a 12 x 4.3 cm non-nipple bearing skin ellipse.  The\nspecimen is oriented with \"one clip superior\", \"two clips lateral\" and\n\"deep is on implant\" per the requisition slip.  The skin has two flat dark\nbrown lesions (0.3 and 0.5 cm) and two scars (a circular scar with a\ndiameter of 5.3 cm that has a second central 1.8 x 1.0 cm scar).  The\nspecimen is inked as follows: superior   red, inferior   green, medial\norange, lateral   yellow, anterior   skin, posterior   black.  Sectioning\nreveals a 1.0 x 0.7 x 0.5 cm thickened possible lesion that abuts the\nnearest deep margin and is 5 mm from the nearest superior margin.  The\nremaining specimen is fatty with no significant fibrous tissue or\nadditional lesions. No lymph nodes are present on the lateral aspect of the\nspecimen.   Cassette: A1   skin lesions, A2   skin scars, A3-A6   entire\npossible lesion, A7-A10   representative sections of remaining specimen,\nincluding surgical borders.\n                       Formalin fixation time: 9-11 hours.\nB.   Container designation: \"axillary tissue left side\" --  Received fresh\nfor intraoperative consultation is a 3.5 x 2.0 x 0.9 cm portion of yellow\nlobulated adipose tissue.  The specimen is sectioned to reveal no discrete\nlymph nodes.  Cassettes: entirely submitted in B1-B3.\nINTRAOPERATIVE CONSULTATION DIAGNOSIS   AXILLARY TISSUE: NO GROSS TUMOR OR\nLYMPH NODE (XX)\nC.   Container designation: \"right breast\" --  Received fresh for\nintraoperative consultation is a 528.5 gram, 22 x 17 x 3 cm simple\nmastectomy specimen, partially surfaced with a 7.5 x 4.9 cm central nipple\nbearing skin ellipse. The breast has a clip on one end designated \"clip in\naxilla\" per the requisition slip. The skin has a scar surrounding the\nareola and a 0.3 cm dark brown flat lesion at the 3:00 edge.  A 0.7 x 0.3 x\n0.2 cm calcified focus is present at approximately 6:30, 2 cm from the\nnipple and 1 cm from all surgical borders.  The remaining specimen contains about\n40% thickened fluid-filled sacic multinodular fibrous stroma.  No discrete lesions are\ngrossly identified.  No lymph nodes are present on the lateral aspect of\nthe specimen.  Cassettes: C1   nipple and skin including lesion and scar,\nC2-C3   upper outer quadrant, including anterior margin at 10:00, 2 cm from\nthe skin edge, C4-C5   lower outer quadrant, including fibrous tissue and\nanterior margin at approximately 6:30, 1 cm from skin edge, C6-C7   lower\ninner quadrant including anterior margin at approximately 3:30, 2.5 cm from\nskin edge, C8-C9   upper inner quadrant including anterior margin at\napproximately 2:30, 2.5 cm from skin edge, and C10   calcified focus, after\ndecalcification.\n      Formalin fixation time: 8.5   10.5 hours.\nINTRAOPERATIVE CONSULTATION DIAGNOSIS   RIGHT BREAST: SURGICAL BORDERS GROSSLY\nNEGATIVE (XX)\nD.   Container designation: \"right axillary contents\" --  Received fresh\nfor intraoperative cytology are two lymph nodes, 0.7 and 1.3 cm.  The\nsmaller node is uninked and bisected, the larger node is inked blue and\nbisected longitudinally.  Scrape preps are performed.  Cassettes: D1\nsmaller lymph node, D2   larger lymph node.\nINTRAOPERATIVE CYTOLOGY DIAGNOSIS   R AXILLARY NODE: NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR\n(XX)\nE.   Container designation: \"Additional right axillary contents\" --  The\nspecimen consists of a 7.0 x 6.5 x 2.5 cm aggregate of fat containing three\npossible lymph nodes measuring up to 1.0 cm.

MALIGNANT PHYLLODES TUMOR\n  2.  TUMOR FOCALLY WITHIN 1 MM OF THE INFERIOR MARGIN\n\nBreast Tumor Information:\nType of specimen(s):  Lumpectomy, right breast\nHistologic Type:  Phyllodes tumor, Malignant\nSize:    7.5 x 6.5 x 4.5 cm\nMitotic rate:  Up to 11 per 10 hpfs\nCellularity:  High\nResection surgical borders:  Negative; Within 1 mm focally (inferior margin)\nOther findings:  Stomal overgrow present\n    Satellite small lump present.\nDiagnosisComment:\nThis case was reviewed in consultation by pathologists at UCSF (see ***PATH-NUMBER[1]).  The following paragraphs are taken from the comments in the consultation report:\n\n\"Based on the gross description and the microscopic sections, the right lumpectomy shows two apparent masses that are juxtaposed to each other with abrupt transition in morphologic features (best demonstrated on slide 11).  The larger mass is composed of proliferation of highly cellular spindle cells growing in interweaving fascicles with no obvious epithelial differentiation.  Rare elongated non-cancerous tubules are noted within the periphery of the spindle cell mass.  the spindle cells have pale eosinophilic cytoplasm and indistinct cell borders.  The nuclei show a vesicular chromatin pattern with inconspicuous nucleoli.  Mitotic activity varies regionally, but overall is moderate to high, and measures up to 11 mitotic figures/10hpfs.  No tissue death is identified.  No heterologous elements (such as lipogenic or chondroid differentiation) are identified in the slides available for review.  Although the mass has an overall well-circumscribed contour, irregular large tongues of growth and microscopic infiltration into adjacent fat are noted, and a small satellite small lump is seen on slide 26.  \n\nThe smaller small lump shows a fibroepithelial lesion that in some areas with paucicellular stroma is reminiscent of a fibroadenoma, but in other areas displaying increased stromal cellularity and mitotic activity (I found 2 mitotic figures in one high power field on slide 8) beyond what would be seen in fibroadenomas and would place this small lump into the category of phyllodes tumor.\n\nBased on the presence of a phyllodes tumor in the smaller small lump and the juxtaposition of the two small lumps, the differential diagnosis for the larger mass with cellular spindle cells would most likely be part of the phyllodes tumor as the result of stromal overgrowth.  Other consideration includes metaplastic malignant epithelial tumor or less likely other mesenchymal tumors. \n\nThe following stains were performed and interpreted at HMC: CD34 patchy positivity, SMA positive, S-100 negative , Desmin negative, LCA negative, Oscar/keratin negative.  The following stains were performed at UCSF: keratin MNF1 negative, p63 negative.  \n\nNegative staining for epithelial markers and p63 helps exclude the possibility of a metaplastic breast malignant epithelial tumor.  Negative S100 and desmin argues against skin cancer and leiomyomalignant tumor of connective tissue respectively.  The histologic features are not those of  an angiomalignant tumor of connective tissue.  Patchy positivity for CD34 can be seen in the stromal component of phyllodes tumors.  Furthermore, the presence of rare elongated non-cancerous tubules within the large mass also supports this as phyllodes tumor.\n\nThis phyllodes tumor is further categorized as malignant based on stromal overgrowth with highly cellular stroma, high mitotic activity, and irregular infiltrative border.  \n\nBased on slides available for review, surgical borders are negative but close (<1mm to yellow inked inferior margin) and at least one satellite small lump is noted.  Ideally, treatment for malignant phyllodes tumors should include widely clear surgical borders (1 cm if possible).  Therefore, close follow-up is recommended for return of disease, and re-excision may merit consideration.\"  \n\nPreliminary findings called to the office of Dr. **NAME[ZZZ YYY] on **DATE[May 29 12].\nGrossDescription:\nReceived in formalin, labeled \"right breast lumpectomy\" is a lumpectomy specimen consisting of a strip of tan skin (7 x 0.5 x 0.5 cm) with attached rubbery tan-yellow tissue (8.5 x 8.5 x 6 cm).  Metal tags mark the cranial/superior margin, caudal/inferior margin, medial margin and lateral margin.  The specimen is differentially inked as follows: superior-blue ink, inferior-yellow ink, anterior-black ink, posterior-green ink, medial and lateral-red ink.  \n\nThe specimen is serially sectioned into fourteen lamellae from medial (lamella 1) to lateral (lamella 14) direction.  A large circumscribed, soft to rubbery pink-tan mass (7.5 x 6.5 x 4.5 cm) has a uniform cut surface and is found within lamellae 1 through 13.  The mass grossly approaches to within 1.5 cm of the superior margin, 0.1 cm of the inferior margin, 0.1 cm of the anterior margin, 0.2 cm of the posterior margin, 0.4 cm of the medial margin and 0.6 cm of the lateral margin.  \n\nAlso found in lamellae 4 through 10 is a well-circumscribed rubbery firm and fibrous white small lump (4.2 x 3 x 2.5 cm) which is found adjacent and superior to the previously described mass.  A tissue sampling clip is found in lamella 8 within the fibrous small lump.  Remainder of the specimen consists of fibroadipose tissue tissue.  Representative sections are submitted as follows:\n\nBlock Summary:\n1.  -  Lamella 1, representative perpendicular sections of medial margin, mass.\n2.  -  Lamella 2, anterior section, mass.\n3.  -  Lamella 3, inferior and anterior section, mass.\n4.  -  Lamella 4, superior and anterior section, fibrous small lump.\n5.  -  Lamella 4, inferior and anterior section, mass.\n6.  -  Lamella 5, anterior section, fibrous small lump and mass.\n7.  -  Lamella 5, inferior and anterior section, mass.\n8.  -  Lamella 6, superior and anterior section, fibrous small lump.\n9.  -  Lamella 6, anterior section, fibrous small lump and mass.\n10.  -  Lamella 7, superior and anterior section, fibrous small lump.\n11.  -  Lamella 7, anterior section, fibrous small lump and mass.\n12.  -  Lamella 7, inferior and anterior section, mass.\n13.  -  Lamella 8, superior and anterior section, fibrous small lump.\n14.  -  Lamella 8, anterior section, fibrous small lump and mass, location of tissue sampling clip.\n15.  -  Lamella 8, anterior section, fibrous small lump and mass.\n16.  -  Lamella 8, posterior section, fibrous small lump and mass.\n17.  -  Lamella 8, skin and anterior section, mass.\n18.  -  Lamella 8, inferior section, mass.\n19.  -  Lamella 9, superior and anterior section, fibrous small lump.\n20.  -  Lamella 9, superior and posterior section, fibrous small lump.\n21.  -  Lamella 9, inferior and posterior section, mass.\n22.  -  Lamella 10, superior and anterior section, fibrous small lump.\n23.  -  Lamella 10, inferior and posterior section, mass.\n24.  -  Lamella 11, superior and posterior section.\n25.  -  Lamella 11, skin and anterior section, mass.\n26.  -  Lamella 11, posterior section, mass.\n27.  -  Lamella 12, anterior and posterior section, mass.\n28.  -  Lamella 12, posterior section, mass.\n29.  -  Lamella 12, inferior and anterior section, mass.\n30.  -  Lamella 13, posterior section, mass.\n31-32.  -  Lamella 14, representative perpendicular sections of lateral margin.\n\nThe specimen was received in formalin on **DATE[May 21 12] at 15:15 hours, for a total fixation time of approximately 29.5 hours.\nMicroscopicDescription:\nThe microscopic findings support the diagnosis.\nA: Right breast lumpectomy\n"

Container designation: \"left breast mastectomy\" --  The specimen\nconsists of an oriented (short superior, long lateral), 140 gram, 15.0 x\n12.5 x 2.5 cm simple left mastectomy.  The mastectomy is surfaced by a 16.5\nx 5.0 cm blue-dyed nipple bearing skin ellipse. The nipple has superficial\nsloughing skin but is not retraced.  Also received separate unattached is a\n4.5 x 2.0 x 1.5 cm additional portion of fatty soft tissue. The mastectomy\ndeep margin is inked black, the anterior margin is inked blue and the most\nlateral skin edge is overlaid with red ink.  There is a 2.6 x 1.5 x 1.0 cm\nirregular bordered fibrotic area at 2 o'clock, 3.0 cm from the nipple.  The\nfibrotic area is 1.5 cm or greater from the inked surgical borders.  The fibrotic\narea contains a hemorrhagic tissue sampling site containing an intraparenchymal\nmetallic marking clip.  There are no other fibrotic areas or mass lesions\nidentified.  The remainder of the specimen is predominantly fat admixed\nwith a minimal amount of fibrous tissue (15%).  There are no lesions\nunderlying the nipple and no lymph nodes identified at the lateral aspect\nof the specimen.  The separately received portion of unoriented fatty soft\ntissue is inked green.  The cut surfaces are vascular with no lymph nodes\nor mass lesions identified.

The accompanying report is also received.\nMicroscopicDescription:\n  The slides are from the right middle lobe biopsies per the accompanied report and consist of several fragments of bronchial mucosa as well as portion of alveolated lung parenchyma.  Both the bronchial mucosa and the alveolated lung parenchyma show several groups of malignant cells with features consistent with poorly differentiated malignant epithelial tumor present in lymphatic vessels.  The tumor cells have large pleomorphic hyperchromatic nuclei and eosinophilic, slightly vacuolated cytoplasm.  The immunoperoxidase stains which are received show the tumor cells to be strongly positive for CK7 and negative for CK20, CDX2, P63 and TTF1.  The morphologic features, in conjunction with this immunophenotype, are consistent with a non small cell malignant epithelial tumor with features favoring an glandular cancer and although a primary lung glandular cancer cannot be ruled out, other sites should also be considered.  Clinical and imaging correlation is recommended.\n1: Outside slide consult charge\n"

Mucin production is present, but is not a prominent feature.  The ovarian serous malignant epithelial tumor is also growing in a glandular pattern, but it lacks the slit-like spaces of the endometrial tumor, and shows much more mucin production.  In addition, no involvement of the ovarian surface, bilateral parametria, or uterine serosa was observed.  These features would favor two synchronous primaries.  However, the ovarian tumor has a fluid-filled sacic background and consists entirely of intraepithelial malignant epithelial tumor, with no lower-grade \\\"borderline\\\" areas observed.  This is distinctly unusual, and a spread of cancer cannot be excluded.  If the ovarian tumor represents a spread of cancer from the endometrium, the endometrial stage would be pT3a.  Clinical correlation is suggested.      P53 immunohistochemical stains were performed on both the ovarian and endometrial tumors and were both positive, confirming serous subtype.  Given the mucin production of the ovarian tumor, a CK20 immunohistochemical stain was also performed to exclude a colonic spread of cancer, and was negative.  This case was reviewed at the Intradepartmental Consensus Conference.

Received in formalin is a 31 in length x 9.5 cm. in circumference portion of unopened colon with one end closed with staples.  The serosal surface is tan-pink and is focally hemorrhagic near the opened end.  There is a moderate amount of attached fat that measures up to 9.5 cm. in length. There is a small attached sheath of omentum that measures 9.3 cm. in length and up to 13 cm. in diameter.  Opening shows a moderate amount of brown to green thickened fecal material.  There are mostly irregular tan to pink mucosal folds with multiple scattered diverticula.  Located 10.5 cm. away from the stapled end there is a narrowed area that shows a somewhat thickened, pink to hemorrhagic possible mass measuring 1.8 x 2.2 cm.  This mass is located 21.2 cm. away from the opposite opened end and less than 2 cm. away from the radial margin.  Located 3.2 cm. away from the opened end there is a slightly raised tan small lump measuring 0.5 x 0.5 cm.  It is entirely submitted.  The serosal surface at the area of the mass is inked black and the radial margin is inked green.  This mass is entirely submitted.  Sectioning through the attached fat shows fifteen tan to pink possible lymph nodes measuring from 0.2 up to 0.6 cm.  Representative sections are submitted as follows: \"1\" - stapled end; \"2\" - opposite opened end; \"3\" - diverticula; \"4\" - irregular mucosa; \"5\" - small lump near the opened end; \"6-7\" - radial margin; \"8-13\" - mass; \"14\" - three possible nodes; \"15\" - six possible nodes; \"16\" - six possible nodes; \"17\" - omentum./AKC,MRJ\nMICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION: The specimen consists of a section of colon showing infiltrating cancer, moderately differentiated glandular cancer composed of irregular glands lined by columnar epithelium with elongated hyperchromatic nuclei. The tumor exhibits large areas of mucin lakes. The tumor appears to be arising from a tubulovillous adenoma with high-grade abnormal cell growth. The tumor invades into the the pericolonic fat and present focally on the serosal surface. Immunohistochemical stain (AE1/3) with appropriately working controls was performed on the specimen (A9) for qualitative impression and it highlight the tumor on the serosal surface. Althought the area where the tumor is present on the serosa does not show rupture, an adjacent area shows extravasated mucin protruding outside the serosal surface through a ruptured area. No lymphvascular invasion is identified.  Resection surgical borders, as well as the radial margin, are negative for malignant epithelial tumor.  Sections from the omentum reveal no evidence of infiltrating cancer malignant epithelial tumor.  There are fifteen lymph nodes identified with no evidence of infiltrating cancer malignant epithelial tumor.\nTISSUE SUBMITTED:   COLECTOMY, PARTIAL, TRANSVERSE AND SPLENIC FLEXURE\n"

A small amount of blood is present in the right main bronchus and the smaller bronchi on the right side.  The right and left lungs weigh 680 and 890 grams respectively.  The pleural surfaces exhibit scattered anthracosis.  There is a large irregularly nodular mass occupying the apical portion of the right upper lobe which is adherent to the chest wall.  Sectioning reveals areas of tissue death, black pigmentation and small areas of bleeding.  The entire upper lobe is replaced by this mass.  There are small yellow-white firm small lumps on the surface of the lower lobe of the left lung.  Sectioning through the lungs reveal a large amount of blood tinged fluid exuding through the cut surfaces.  There is bilateral acute congestion and severe bilateral anthracosis.  The pulmonary vessels occupy the usual relationships without evidence of emboli.  \n\nHepatobiliary System:  The liver weighs 1250 grams and has a smooth, glistening surface.

Please correlate clinically and with the radiographic findings. |\nGrossDescription:\nReceived fresh labeled \"XXXXXX\" are approximately seven cores of tan-white tissue measuring up to 1.0 cm in length and <0.1 cm in diameter.  Air-dried, Diff-Quik stain imprints are prepared for intraoperative consultation.  A portion of the specimen is saved for possible cultures.  The remaining tissue is placed in formalin, and submitted in toto for light microscopy evaluation in one cassette.\nMicroscopicDescription:\nThe Hematoxylin and Eosin-stained sections demonstrates thin cores of lung parenchyma infiltrated by numerous tumor cells found singly or in nests.  The tumor cells are variable in size and shape and generally have abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm with indistinct cytoplasmic boarders and hyperchromatic large nuclei.  A few associated mitotic figures are seen.  The tumor lacks a glanular pattern and no intercellular bridges are seen.  The tumor cells are found in association with acute inflammation and background scarring process.  No small area of inflammations or tissue death is seen.  Focal non-cancerous cartilage and focal non-cancerous respiratory mucosa are present.  The Diff-Quik touch prep stains demonstrate numerous large abnormal cells with pleomorphic hyperchromatic nuclei and abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm.  In the background, there are numerous macrophages, neutrophils and fewer small lymphocytes.  Immunohistochemical stains were conducted.  The tumor labels with cytokeratin 7, cytokeratin 20 (focal), p63 (rare), cytokeratin 5/6 (rare, weak), and TTF-1.  The tumor does not label with CDX2 or PSA (positive controls intact). \n\nNOTES:  Dr. **NAME[XXX] has reviewed this case and concurs with the diagnosis.  Results were discussed with Dr. **NAME[M.

There is an abundant amount of attached tan/yellow lobular mesenteric fat. The appendix is not present. The colon is opened to reveal a 0.5 cm in greatest dimension mucosa defect surrounded by black ink. This area is consistent with the previous growth protruding from a mucous membraneectomy site. This area is 12.5 cm from the proximal resection margin and 15 cm from the distal resection margin. No growth protruding from a mucous membrane or infiltrating cancer tumor is identified grossly in this area. There is a second area of submucosal ink 3 cm from the growth protruding from a mucous membraneectomy site. No infiltrating cancer tumor is identified in this area. The second area is greater than 10 cm from both the proximal and distal resection surgical borders. Both of the areas are greater than 5 cm from the radial/mesenteric resection margin. There is a 1.0 x 1.0 x 0.4 cm flattened centrally ulcerated mass identified 2 cm from the two previously described growth protruding from a mucous membraneectomy site. This area is consistent with an area of infiltrating cancer tumor and is located 7 cm from the proximal resection margin and greater than 15 cm from the distal resection margin. No invasion into the underlying fat is identified and the area is greater than 5 cm from the radial resection margin. The remaining mucosa is tan and glistening with normal folds. No other masses or suspicious lesions are appreciated. Representative sections are submitted. Summary of sections: A  proximal resection margin taken en face; B  distal resection margin taken en face; C  radial resection margin; D-E  infiltrating cancer tumor; F-H  growth protruding from a mucous membraneectomy sites; I-J  intact lymph nodes.  **INITIALS\nMicroscopic Description The mucosal and radial surgical borders are free of tumor.  The lesion in blocks D and E shows an infiltrating cancer glandular cancer which extends into the submucosa only.  No deep invasion is seen.  Sections from the additional tissue sampling sites show some pigment within the submucosal stroma with some reactive changes but no adenomatous change or infiltrating cancer tumor is seen.  Thirteen lymph nodes are identified and none of these show spread of cancer.  **INITIALS\nAmendments: Electronically Signed Out By **NAME[ZZZ, YYY M]. Procedures/Addenda\n"

Specimen is totally embedded in one cassette. GAR\nMicroscopic Description Multiple sections of the right breast needle core tissue sampling show fibrotic pressed tissue with extensive malignant cell population displaying a glandular and focal solid growth pattern with moderate nuclear pleomorphism exhibited by oval nuclei with pseudonuclear inclusions, minimal cytoplasm, and no mitotic figures.  Occasional nests of ductal cells displaying a cellular proliferation with focal myoepithelial cells are noted somewhat suggestive of at least atypical ductal excessive cell growth. Immunoperoxidase stains are performed with appropriate controls and the results are as follows: 1.  Actin:   Negative for a myoepithelial cell layer with extensive positivity for fibroblast 2.  CD34:   Positive for occasional myoepithelial cells and blood vessels without evidence of vascular infiltration by cancer 3.   Estrogen receptor:  Strongly positive 4.   KCAM:  Strongly diffusely positive 5.   Progesterone receptor:  Moderate to strongly positive The overall staining pattern confirms the presence of infiltrating cancer ductal malignant epithelial tumor.  No microcalcifications or vascular infiltration by cancer is seen.\nSpecimen Source:   \\S\\core tissue sampling, right breast x 4\\S\\\\S\\0  \n"

All internal and external controls were appropriately reactive.\nThe steroid receptor result is positive if at least 1% of tumor cell nuclei\nshow specific staining. For positive cases the \"fraction of cells staining\"\nis a visual estimate subject to observer variation. For Her2, membrane\npositivity was scored according to **NAME[ZZZ] ASCP/CAP consensus (J Clin Oncol\n25:188, 2007):  0-1+ is negative for overexpression, 2+ is equivocal, and\n3+ is positive.\n\nCOMMENT:  This case has been amended to modify the her-2 results above.  No\nother changes were made. Complete membrane staining is seen in over 30% of\ntumor cells, however, the staining intensity is moderate to focally strong\nand a 2+ score is most appropriate followed up her-2 FISH testing.\nThe infiltrating malignant epithelial tumor demonstrates only a focal tubular formation and\nabundant single cell infiltrating pattern.  Immunohistochemical studies,\nusing appropriately reactive controls, demonstrate strong staining of the\ntumor with e-cadherin consistent with a ductal origin.\n\nREVIEWED BY:  Dr. **NAME[M.

Though the largest studies have used 10% as a \n  threshold for positivity, others have recommended a cutoff as low as 1%. \n\nHER-2/neu\n  Analysis is performed using Chromavision Automated Cellular Imaging System (ACIS) on formalin-fixed paraffin-\n  embedded section stained by immunohistochemical on the Ventana Benchmark XT automated stainer using HER-2/neu \n  (4B5)  Rabbit Monoclonal Antibody.\n\n  Slides were reviewed by an in-house pathologist and deemed adequate for analysis.  All controls (negative, positive, and \n  equivocal) were appropriate.\n\n  The results obtained from the ChromaVision ACIS correspond to the ASCO/CAP scoring criteria in the following \n  manner, as determined by in-house studies:\n\n  ChromaVision:         ASCO/CAP \n  Result:          Score:\n\n  Less than 1.5         0       (No staining)\n\n  Less than 1.5         1+        (Weak, incomplete membrane staining)\n\n  1.5 to 3.4              2+        (Complete membrane staining that is either nonuniform or weak in \n                       intensity, but with obvious circumferential distribution in at least 10% of the \n                       cells, or intense complete membrane staining in less than 30% of infiltrating cancer \n                       tumor cells)\n\n  Greater than 3.4       3+       (Uniform, intense membrane staining in greater or lesser than 30% \n                       infiltrating cancer tumor cells)\n\n  A ChromaVision ACIS score of 1.5 to 3.4 is reflexed to Her-2/neu testing by FISH methods, unless otherwise \n  specified.  This is in accordance with CAP recommendations (Strategic Science I Meeting, **DATE[Jan 2003], **PLACE, \n  IL).\n\n  Per the 2007 joint guidelines of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) and the College of American \n  Pathologists (CAP) on HER2 testing in breast cancer, specimens should be fixed in 10% neutral buffered \n  formalin for intervals ranging from 6 hours to no more than 48 hours.  Prolonged fixation, for example more than \n  48 hours, may result in false-negative results.  Fixation times for needle biopsies have not been addressed.  \n  \nReferences:\n  1.

The clinical and histologic features are best in keeping with prostatic duct glandular cancer with a focal cribriform, Grade 4 pattern in addition to an apparent more exophytic papillary pattern.  Prostatic duct glandular cancers may more often have a course approximating a Gleason grade 4+4, sum 8 form of the much more common prostatic glandular cancer of prostatic acinar derivation.  Only limited non-neoplastic prostate tissue is represented without representation of seminal vesicle tissue without evidence of vascular infiltration by cancer or nerve invasion as sampled.

Other parts of the tumor have a focal cribriform back to back gland arrangement with glandular confluence and infiltrating cancer features with general absence of immunoreactive cells for high molecular weight cytokeratin and p63 with only rare areas with some background non-neoplastic prostatic glands with some immunoreactive cells.  The lesion diffusely expresses prostatic specific antigen and in most areas expresses p504 (AMCAR) consistent with a prostate derived lesion.\n\nProstate Cancer Information\nBased on AJCC/UICC TNM, 7th edition\n\nProcedure:  Transurethral prostatic resection \nSpecimen size:  Weight:  1.6 g\nHistologic type:  Prostatic duct glandular cancer \nHistologic grade\n    Total Gleason score:  4+4, sum 8\nTumor quantitation:  Proportion (percentage) of prostatic tissue involved by tumor:  Approximately 96%./r/n\nA: PROSTATIC URETHRAL LESION, excision\n"

The specimen has been fixed in formalin for greater than 6 hours and less than 48 hours. The specimen consists of a modified radical mastectomy specimen which includes a skin ellipse measuring 23.4 x 10.7 x 0.2 cm. Centrally located is a nipple and areola measuring 3.7 x 3.5 x 0.8 cm. The skin surface is light tan and smooth with one brown macule measuring 0.4 cm in greatest dimension. The edges are regular and extend to within 2.1 cm of the inferior surgical margin. Underlying the skin ellipse is fibroadipose tissue breast tissue measuring 22.5 x 18.9 x 5.2 cm. The specimen is serially sectioned revealing yellow adipose tissue with grey-white breast tissue marbling through it. An ill-defined gray-white mass lesion is present located centrally in the breast measuring 1.1 x 1 x 0.7 cm. The mass lesion is associated with a metal marking pellet and extends to within 1.6 cm of the posterior inked surgical margin. Sections through the remaining tissue reveal no additional mass lesions or areas of bleeding. Attached to the breast is an axillary tail measuring 8 x 7.7 x 2 cm. Sections through the adipose tissue reveal several dark tan to pale tan lymph nodes ranging up to 1.5 x 1.1 x 0.9 cm. Lymph nodes are dissected away from the adipose tissue and submitted. Representative sections are submitted as follows: Cassette A: Nipple, cassette B: Skin, cassette C: Mass lesion located closest to posterior inked surgical margin, cassettes D - F: Mass lesion, cassette G: Upper inner quadrant, cassette H: Lower inner quadrant, cassette I: Upper outer quadrant, cassette J: Lower outer quadrant, cassette K: 2 lymph nodes, cassette L: 2 lymph nodes, cassette M: 4 lymph nodes, cassette N: 2 lymph nodes, cassette O: 2 lymph nodes, cassette P: 3 lymph nodes, cassette Q: 2 lymph nodes, cassette R: 2 lymph nodes, cassette S: One lymph node. **DATE[Jun 19 2012] SMC/AO\n<CLINICAL INFO>\nleft breast cancer\n1).

Moderately differentiated glandular cancer arising in a tubulovillous adenoma.   B.     Lesion extends to within 0.9 cm of growth protruding from a mucous membrane base.  C.     Negative for evidence of definitive stalk invasion.   D.     Base of growth protruding from a mucous membrane negative for evidence of abnormal cell growth.   E.     Separate foci of at least high grade glandular abnormal cell growth in a separately grossly described tubulovillous adenoma, base of growth protruding from a mucous membrane negative for evidence of abnormal cell growth. Comment:    It is not clear whether the lesions represent two separate growth protruding from a mucous membranes at the same location or one single fragmented growth protruding from a mucous membrane.  No area of malignant epithelial tumor or high grade abnormal cell growth in either growth protruding from a mucous membrane is closer than 0.9 cm from the respective bases of excision.  Clinical correlation is suggested.                       1 Electronically Signed Out By **NAME[XXX M. WWW], M.D.\nGross Description Specimen #1 is received in formalin and labeled with the patient name and \"colon growth protruding from a mucous membrane 45 cm\". The specimen consists of two red-tan pediculated growth protruding from a mucous membranes. The first growth protruding from a mucous membrane measures 2.4 x 2 x 1.8 cm.  The growth protruding from a mucous membrane sets on a stalk measuring 1 cm in length x 0.8 cm in diameter. The surface of the growth protruding from a mucous membrane is red-pink, lobular and friable. The resection margin is inked black. Sectioning reveals a villous appearance and is markedly friable. The second growth protruding from a mucous membrane measures 1.8 x 1.5 x 1.3 cm. The growth protruding from a mucous membrane sets on a stalk measuring 0.4 cm in length x 0.6 cm in diameter. The resection margin is inked blue.  The external surface of the growth protruding from a mucous membrane is red-tan and slightly granular. The cut surface is red-pink, slightly hemorrhagic and solid. A small amount of mucin material is identified.  The first described growth protruding from a mucous membrane is totally submitted in (blocks A-D). The second growth protruding from a mucous membrane is totally submitted in (blocks E-F). **INITIALS\nMicroscopic Description Microscopic examination reveals sections of growth protruding from a mucous membraneoid colonic lesions demonstrating a focal villiform architecture and pseudostratified columnar lining epithelium with elongated hyperchromatic nuclei.  Multiple foci of the smaller grossly described growth protruding from a mucous membrane demonstrate cribriform gland formation with rounded atypical nuclei with high nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratios also noted.  The atypical nuclei demonstrate coarse chromatin and occasional nucleoli.  Definitive stalk invasion is not identified.  The lesion extends to within 0.9 cm of the growth protruding from a mucous membrane base and no evidence of obvious abnormal cell growth is noted at the growth protruding from a mucous membrane excision base.  The larger grossly described growth protruding from a mucous membrane also demonstrates foci of at least high grade glandular abnormal cell growth which do not demonstrate evidence of stalk invasion.  The base of the larger growth protruding from a mucous membrane is also negative for abnormal cell growth. CBG/js\n"

See Comment.  COMMENT:  This report was faxed to the Radiologist at the Breast Imaging Services on **DATE[May 16 12].  **INITIALS\nGross Description The specimen, labeled left breast stereotactic tissue sampling, received in formalin, consists of two cassettes one of which is designated with a Steri-Strip. The undesignated cassette contains a 2.5x2.5x0.3 cm aggregate of tan/pink fibroadipose breast tissue fragments which were placed in formalin at 11:45 am and are now submitted in cassette A. The taped, designated cassette contains a 2.5x2.3x0.3 cm aggregate of tan/pink fibroadipose breast tissue fragments which were placed in formalin at 11:45 am and are now submitted in cassette B.     HM/mbc\nMicroscopic Description Sections of the left breast show fibrous and adipose tissue with essentially unremarkable lobular units; however, the ducts show modest dilatation in several with a micropapillary apocrine appearing excessive cell growth. These ducts occasional show small foci of central tissue death in the ducts containing the micropapillary atypical hyperplastic change. The tissue sampling also shows focal dystrophic calcification within these ducts.  NOTE: The ductal changes are suspicious for a micropapillary ductal malignant epithelial tumor localized tumor; the case will be forwarded to Dr. **NAME[UUU] Page and his colleagues for review.  **INITIALS\nAmendments: Amended:  **DATE[May 21 2012] by **NAME[TTT SSS RRR] Reason: OUTSIDE CONSULTATION RESULTS      Dr. **NAME[XXX M.

We agree that there is extensive ductal malignant epithelial tumor in\n  situ with a focal area suspicious for invasion but also agree that because\n  this area is within the tissue sampling needle tract, that it brings up the possibility\n  of pseudo-invasion/entrapped epithelium. The received calponin and p63\n  immunostains show a lack of myoepithelial cells, which is consistent with\n  either displaced epithelium or invasion. After review by Drs **NAME[ZZZ, YYY]\n  and **NAME[XXX], we all agree that because these atypical glands are not present\n  outside of the tissue sampling tract, that they most likely represent displaced\n  epithelium and not infiltrating cancer malignant epithelial tumor.\n  Procedures used to establish the diagnosis:\n  RoutineMATERIALS RECEIVED:\n  Label Consult Accession No Blocks/Slides Description\n   A ***PATH-NUMBER[1]  0B,7S  Right breast\n"

A localization wire with hook tip is embedded within the specimen.  Sutures are present designated as follows:  long = lateral, short = superior, double = deep.  The anterior edge contains a sliver of tan skin 3.5 cm in length and 0.1 to 0.2 cm in width.  The specimen is somewhat flattened in the medial to lateral aspect.  No skeletal muscle is identified at the designated deep margin.  The lateral aspect is marked with black ink with the medial aspect with blue ink with the remaining surgical borders identified by the confluence of inks.  Sectioning reveals an eccentrically located 1.8 x 1.5 x 1.4 cm somewhat stellate mass with central bleeding consistent with prior tissue sampling site.  Tumor extends to within approximately 0.2 cm of the closest lateral margin and approximately 0.8 cm of the closest medial margin.  The remaining surgical borders are more widely clear.  The remainder of the breast demonstrates lobulated yellow fatty tissue with minimal scarring process.  No additional suspicious areas are seen.

One margin is closed with metal sutures and the opposite margin is unsutured.  There is a white silk suture adjacent to the sutured margin indicating the sutured margin to be proximal.  8.5 cm from the proximal margin of resection there is a 7.5 x 5.8 x 2.8 cm circumferential partially growth protruding from a mucous membraneoid neoplastic appearing lesion which involves the full thickness of the bowel wall and focally infiltrates into the adjacent pericolonic soft tissues.  The serosa is hyperemic but remains smooth.  The lesion is 8 cm from the ligated and grossly uninvolved mesenteric apex margin.  Proximal to the lesion the bowel shows a few diverticula.  Distal to the lesion the bowel shows no focal lesions.  No growth protruding from a mucous membranes or other masses are identified.  The proximal and distal surgical borders are grossly uninvolved.  The attached fat is found to contain multiple grossly non-cancerous appearing lymph nodes ranging from 0.2 to 1.2 cm in greatest dimension.  Detachable within the same container is a 5.3 x 0.5 x 0.5 cm strip of soft tissue containing numerous metal sutures and a 2.1 x 1.3 x 0.7 cm irregular piece of yellow and tan tissue.

DGD/mbc\nGross Description Specimen 1 labeled left breast tissue, received in formalin, consists of a 471 gram, 18.0x16.0x4.0 cm intact simple mastectomy specimen. The specimen is partially surfaced by a 5.5x3.8 cm tan wrinkled skin ellipse. The everted nipple measures 1.4 cm in diameter. The deep margin is inked black and sectioning reveals approximately equal proportions of yellow adipose tissue and dense white fibrofluid-filled sacic breast tissue. No masses, suspicious lesions or previous tissue sampling sites are identified. Representative sections are submitted. Summary of sections: 1A-1I  representative sections of fibrofluid-filled sacic breast tissue; 1J  representative section of nipple.  Specimen 2 labeled #1 sentinel node and #2 sentinel node, received fresh for frozen section, consists of two tan/pink lymph nodes measuring 0.8 and 1.5 cm in greatest dimension which are submitted entirely for frozen section, now resubmitted in cassette 2.  Specimen 3 labeled right breast tissue, received in formalin, consists of a 422.2 gram intact simple mastectomy specimen with overall dimensions of 18.0x15.0x4.0 cm. The specimen is partially surfaced by a 6.0x3.5 cm tan wrinkled skin ellipse. The everted nipple measures 1.4 cm in diameter. There is a suture designating the superior aspect. The surgical borders are inked as follows: superficial margin blue, deep margin black, and sectioning reveals a 0.8x0.8x0.7 cm tan/pink tissue sampling cavity, 1.5 cm from the deep margin and 1.7 cm from the superficial margin. Located 3.3 cm lateral from this site is a 1.1x0.8x0.8 cm tan tissue sampling site containing a metal clip. The more lateral tissue sampling site is 0.8 cm from the deep margin and 1.9 cm from the superficial margin. The tissue between the two tissue sampling sites is tan/pink and fibrofluid-filled sacic. The two tissue sampling sites are located in the upper central to outer quadrant. Sectioning through the remaining breast tissue reveals dense white fibrofluid-filled sacic breast tissue. No other definitive masses or tissue sampling sites are identified. Representative sections are submitted. Summary of sections: 3A-3D  central upper quadrant tissue sampling cavity submitted in its entirety to include deep and superficial surgical borders; 3E-3F  breast tissue between the two tissue sampling sites; 3G-3H  second more lateral tissue sampling site to include deep and superficial margin; 3I  large fluid-filled sac/suspicious area directly adjacent second more lateral tissue sampling site; 3J-3K  representative sections of fibrous breast tissue from the upper inner quadrant located approximately 3  3.5 cm from the first more central tissue sampling cavity; 3L-3M  representative sections of fibrous breast tissue from the central aspect of the breast located approximately 1.5  2 cm from the more central tissue sampling cavity; 3N-3O  representative sections of breast tissue from the lower inner quadrant approximately 4.5  5 cm from the first more central tissue sampling cavity; 3P-3Q  representative sections of fibrous breast tissue from the lower outer quadrant approximately 5 cm from the tissue sampling cavity; 3R  representative section of nipple.  HM/mbc\nMicroscopic Description Multiple representative sections of the breast show numerous dilated ducts, scattered non-cancerous lobular units and focal microcalcifications. The ducts show no epithelial proliferation and occasional ducts show apocrine metaplastic change. One of the ducts shows a small sclerotic intraductal papilloma. Sections of the skin of nipple are remarkable for non-cancerous squamous epithelium without atypia and no evidence of lymphvascular infiltration in the dermal lymphatics. There is a small fibroadenoma less than 1 mm in size in block 1I.  Sections of the two lymph nodes show mildly reactive nodes with a modest degree of sinus histiocytosis. There is no evidence of small area of inflammationtous inflammation or metastatic tumor. Sections of the right breast show a single small focus of residual intermediate-grade ductal malignant epithelial tumor localized tumor. The tumor shows a focus where duct epithelium is overfilling the ducts and the nuclear features of the epithelium are relatively pleomorphic with prominent macronucleoli compatible with DCIS. Numerous calcifications are seen within the affected ducts. Also noted in the background breast tissue are large areas of proliferative fibrofluid-filled sacic change and some of the dilated ducts show apocrine metaplastic alterations. No lymphvascular invasion is identified.  DGD/mbc\nAmendments: Electronically Signed Out By DARON **PLACE Procedures/Addenda\n"

RIGHT THYROID LOBE: Two lesions: Papillary micromalignant epithelial tumor, see note #1. - Tumor size:  0.90 mm. - Extent of invasion:  Tumor appears confined to the thyroid. - Angiolymphatic invasion:  Not identified. - Margins:  Clear. Follicular adenoma, see note #2. - Tumor size:  2.8 cm. - Capsular invasion:  Not identified. - Vascular invasion:  Not identified. B.  SKIN OF LEFT NOSE, EXCISION: Mildly acanthotic squamous epithelium, see note #3. Mild chronic inflammation. Note #1:  In additional tissue submitted for permanent sections there is a single, very small focus of papillary micromalignant epithelial tumor that is centrally located and represents an incidental finding.  In the planes of section, this focus confined to the thyroid and is approximately 4 mm from the margin of resection. Note #2:  The entire primary lesion was submitted for histologic examination.  It is thinly encapsulated and consists of thyroid follicular epithelial cells arranged into small microfollicles containing a small amount of luminal colloid.  Unequivocal light microscopic evidence for malignant tumor (capsular/vascular invasion) are not appreciated in the planes of section. Note #3:  Confirmatory immunohistochemical stains are pending.\nGROSS: A.  Received fresh for intraoperative consultation labeled with the patient's name. It is additionally labeled right thyroid lobe with mass. It consists of a 4.4 x \\R\\4.0 cm thyroid lobectomy specimen remarkable for an \\R\\2.4 cm well circumscribed lesion. The resection margin is entirely inked black. The specimen is sectioned revealing a well circumscribed thinly encapsulated \\R\\2.2 cm tan colored lesion. A portion is submitted for a frozen section and smear. INTRAOPERATIVE CONSULTATION DX: Follicular lesion, defer to permanent sections.      (CJM) The residual tissue from frozen section is submitted into Cassette A1. The entire lesion is subsequently submitted into Cassettes A2-A5, and unremarkable thyroid parenchyma in A6. B.  Received designated left nasal lesion is a 1 mm fragment of pink and tan tissue which is entirely submitted as B1.               (AEE)\nMICROSCOPIC: A microscopic examination has been performed. IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY REPORT Using formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissue with the appropriate positive and negative controls, the specimen designated skin of left nose (block B1) is stained for immunoreactive epithelial membrane antigen, S100, CD-34 using an automated immunohistochemical technique. All internal and external controls react appropriately. INTERPRETATION:  Cytoplasmic immunoreactivity for the epithelial membrane antigen stain is noted in unremarkable epithelium only.  The S100 stain is negative in the planes of interest.  The CD-34 stain shows cytoplasmic immunoreactivity in non-cancerous endothelial cells.  Overall, there is no light microscopic/immunohistochemical evidence for neoplasm. These findings support the final diagnosis. Preliminary Diagnosis performed by **NAME[M. ZZZ YYY], M.D. Electronically signed **DATE[Aug 4 2012] 12:24PM Final Diagnosis performed by **NAME[M. ZZZ YYY], M.D. Electronically signed **DATE[Aug 7 2012] 1:52PM\nSPECIMEN:  A.

Received fresh for frozen section designated \"right sentinel node\" is an irregular fragment of yellow-tan lobulated adipose tissue measuring 2.0 x 1.5 x 0.6 cm.  Blue discoloration is noted within the adipose tissue.  Sectioning and palpation of the specimen reveals a single fragmented lymph node candidate measuring 0.7 cm in greatest dimension.  A touch prep is prepared and the specimen is entirely submitted on a single block for frozen section.  Following frozen section, the specimen is submitted in cassette A-FSC.  Sentinel lymph node protocol is observed.  B.  Received in formalin designated \"right breast cancer\" is an ovoid fragment of yellow-tan lobulated adipose tissue measuring 5.0 x 4.0 x 1.8 cm.  The specimen exhibits blue discoloration associated with injection dye.  The specimen is received without orientation.  The specimen is marked with black ink and serially sectioned from end to end to reveal an   ill-defined area of pink-tan firm tumor measuring 1.5 x 1.2 x 0.8 cm.  Tumor abuts multiple inked surfaces.  Multiple representative sections from the specimen are sequentially submitted as follows:  B1\\T\\B2.        representative sections immediately adjacent to area of tumor B3-B5.        entire area of tumor submitted by full cross section B6\\T\\B7.        representative sections immediately adjacent to area of tumor B8.        full cross sections representing each end of the specimen  The specimen is removed from the patient at 11:08 a.m. and placed into formalin at 11:12 a.m.  The specimen is received in pathology at 11:48 a.m. and sectioned and placed into formalin at 12:07 p.m. on **DATE[Jun 16 12].  **INITIALS \nMICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION  Microscopic examination is performed.

Status: SOUT\nMICROSCOPIC INTERPRETATION: RIGHT COLON AND TERMINAL ILEUM; RIGHT HEMICOLECTOMY: INFILTRATING CANCER GLANDULAR CANCER, MODERATELY DIFFERENTIATED. TUMOR LOCATION - RIGHT COLON. TUMOR SIZE - 3.3 CM IN GREATEST DIMENSION. TUMOR CONFIGURATION - GROWTH PROTRUDING FROM A MUCOUS MEMBRANEOID AND INFILTRATIVE. TUMOR INVADES SUBMUCOSA (pT1). NEGATIVE FOR PERINEURAL AND VASCULAR INFILTRATION BY CANCER. APPENDIX - UNREMARKABLE. SURGICAL SURGICAL BORDERS - PROXIMAL AND DISTAL SURGICAL BORDERS ARE NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR. SIXTEEN NON-CANCEROUS LYMPH NODES; NO METASTATIC TUMOR IS IDENTIFIED (pN0). PATHOLOGIC CLASSIFICATION OF CANCER EXTENT - pT1, NO, MX.. Final Signout: **NAME[XXX WWW], MD **DATE[May 09 12]\nGROSS DESCRIPTION: The specimen is received in one container in formalin labeled right colon terminal ileum and consists of a right hemicolectomy specimen as follows:  there is a segment of terminal ileum that measures 6.5 cm. in length x 3.0 cm. in average circumference, and a segment of right colon that measures 23.0 cm. in length x 8.0 cm. in average circumference.  Opening of the terminal ileum reveals unremarkable small intestine mucosa.  Opening of the right colon reveals a growth protruding from a mucous membraneoid mass that measures 3.3 x 2.5 cm.  The mass is located 6.0 cm. from the distal margin.  The mass on sectioning does not grossly invade the colonic wall.  No additional lesions identified. The appendix measures 4.8 cm. in length x 0.5 cm. in average diameter.  On sectioning it is unremarkable.   The pericolic fat measures up to 10.0 cm. in thickness and on sectioning reveals multiple small lymph nodes measuring up to 0.8 cm. in greatest dimension.  representative sections are submitted in 16 cassettes labeled \"A\" through \"P\" as follows:  \"A\" - distal margin, \"B\" - proximal margin, \"C\" through \"H\" - growth protruding from a mucous membraneoid mass entirely submitted, \"I\" - appendix, \"J\" - one lymph node, \"K\" - one lymph node bisected, \"L\" - one lymph node bisected, and \"M\" -\"P\" - multiple lymph nodes in each cassette.\nTissues: COLON.

The tumor cells are positive for cytokeratin 7, TTF-1, and p63 (focally), and they are negative for cytokeratin 20 and cytokeratin 5/6.  The morphologic features and immunophenotypic findings are those of a poorly differentiated glandular cancer consistent with lung primary.  \n\nThe findings were discussed with Dr. **NAME[ZZZ YYY] on **DATE[Dec 16 11] at 4:36 p.m./r/n\nGrossDescription:\nLabeled:      patient name and medical record number, designated lung tissue sampling\nSpecimen:    cylindrical (formalin)\nNumber:      two\nSize:           up to 1.1 x 0.1 x 0.1 cm \nSubmitted/Block:    entirely/1./r/n\nMicroscopicDescription:\nMicroscopic evaluation was performed.

The absence of an ALK rearrangement suggests that the patient may not respond to ALK \n    inhibitors.  Clinical correlation is suggested. \n\n    Reference range:\n    Not Detected:  Less than or equal to 15% of cells with split signals (3  ALK and 45  ALK signals apart by greater \n    than 2 times signal size or single 3  ALK signal) in 50 cells scored.\n    Detected:  Greater than 15% of cells with split signals (3  ALK and 45  ALK signals apart by greater than 2 times \n    signal size or single 3  ALK signal) in 50 cells scored.\n\n    Methodology:\n    After determining the tumor area on the H\\T\\E slide form this formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) patient \n    specimen, ALK gene rearrangement was assessed utilizing the LIS ALK Dual Color, Break Apart Probe assay \n    (Abbot Molecular).  The identification probes for LSI ALK 5  probe (SpectrumGreen) and LSI ALK 3  probe \n    (SpectrumOrange) were hybridized according to the manufacturer s guidelines.  At least 50 non-overlapping \n    nuclei were analyzed and the localization of the LSI ALK 5  probe (green) and LSI ALK 3  probe (orange) signals \n    were recorded and interpreted.\n\n    Intended Use:\n    The LSI ALK (anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase) Dual Color, Break Apart Rearrangement Probe (Abbot Molecular) is \n    designed to detect rearrangements of the ALK gene Fusion of the ALK gene with the echinoderm microtubule-\n    associated protein-like 4 gene (EML4-ALK) can be detected in a subset of non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC).  \n    EML4-ALK fusion is observed primarily in lung glandular cancer.  Patients who harbor this mutation may respond \n    to ALK inhibitors.  Nature 448, 561-566 (2 **DATE[May 2008]).

The performance characteristics of these ASR s were \n    determined by Clarient.  They have not been cleared or approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration \n    (FDA).  The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary.  Clarient is certified under the \n    Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA-88) as qualified to performing high complexity \n    clinical laboratory testing./r/n\nThe following results were performed at Clarient Diagnostic Services, Aliso Viejo, CA and reported by **NAME[XXX WWW], M.D. on **DATE[Jan 29 2012].   \n\nEGFR Mutation Analysis\n\nExon 19 deletionIncreased responsiveness to TKIsDeletions in exon 19 confer ligand independent activation and increase the duration and activation of receptor signaling after ligand binding.  These deletions result in the modified receptors being approximately 100-fold more sensitive than wild-type receptors to inhibition with TKIs. Reference (1).G719S, G719A, G719CIncreased responsiveness to TKIsMutations at codon 719 in exon 18 are associated with response of NSCLC to gefitinib or erlotinib monotherapy (slightly more than 50%), although they are not as responsive as those with deletions in exon 19 or point mutations of codon 858 in exon 21. Reference (1)L858RIncreased responsiveness to TKIsThe missense mutation L858R in exon 21 confers ligand independent activation and increases the duration and activation or receptor signaling after ligand binding.  This mutation results in the modified receptors being more sensitive than wild-type receptors to inhibition with TKIs. Reference (1)L861QIncreased  responsiveness to TKIsThe missense mutation L861Q in exon 21 confers ligand independent activation and increases the duration and activation of receptor signaling after ligand binding.  This mutation results in a modified receptor that has been reported to be more sensitive than wild-type receptor to inhibition with TKIs. Reference (1)S768ILack of responsiveness to TKIsMutations at codon 768 in exon 20 are associated with less responsiveness of NSCLC to gefitinib or erlotinib monotherapy. Reference (2)T790MLack of responsiveness to TKIsT790M point mutation in exon 20 is a frequent cause of secondary resistance to TKIs.  It appears that TKI administration may select for a pre-existing T790M resistance clone. Reference (3)Exon 20 InsertionLack of responsiveness to TKIsInsertions in exon 20 have been associated with lack of clinical response of NSCLC to gefitinib or erlotinib monotherapy both in vitro and in patients despite the fact that they seem to activate EGFR to a similar degree as deletions in exon 19 or exon 21 mutations.  This is a rare mutation, however, and robust clinical data is lacking. Reference (2)References:(1)  **NAME[VVV, UUU M]. et al.  N Engl J Med 350(21): 2129, 2004.\n(2  )Wu, Jenn-Yu et al.

The collected cells were lysed, and the genomic DNA was purified from the sample.  Real-time PCR was used to evaluate specific mutations, deletions and insertions in the tyrosine kinase domain of the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) gene.  Eight reactions containing 30 primer and probe sets were used to target specific regions of exons 18-21 as well as the wild-type sequence.  \n\nIntended Use:  The EGFR mutation analysis be real-time PCR is able to detect the wild-type sequence and 29 known mutations, deletions and insertions found in exons 18-21 of the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain.  The results of this study are to be interpreted in context with other clinical findings in patient care management.  The intended use of this assay is to aid the treating physician in the selection of the appropriate therapy for the patient.  There is a significant association between EGFR mutation, especially exon 19 deletion, and response to TKI' s.  This assay is capable of detecting a mutation of 1% in a background of wild-type alleles.  These mutations are linked to clinical responsiveness to EGFR inhibitors, such as gefitinib (Iressa) and erlotinib (Tarceva)./r/n\n"

Neoplastic cells grow in sheet\nlike groups and are composed of cells with enlarged nuclei often with a\nprominent nucleolus. Several mitotic figures are noted. The cell borders\nare not well defined. Some cells have a slightly spindled appearance. \nThe epithelial nature of these cells is confirmed with an\nimmunohistochemical stain showing diffuse and strong positive\nimmunoreactivity for cytokeratin 7. There is variable but strong positive\nimmunoreactivity for TTF-1 which is typical for tumors primary to the\nlung. The cells are negative with stains for p63 and cytokeratin 5&6. This\npattern would favor glandular cancer over squamous cell malignant epithelial tumor. An\nimmunostain for S-100 protein is negative excluding skin cancer. The\nhistology does not suggest a specific lineage of differentiation. \nIMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY (IHC) REPORT:\nANTIBODIES:RESULTS: \n1. CYTOKERATIN 7 (OV-TL12/30): POSITIVE\n2.

The specimen is totally submitted in one block.\nCOMMENT WORD: The microscopic sections of tissue sampling from the left upper lobe of the lung reveal a proliferation of epithelial cells demonstrating mild atypia and forming gland-like structures.  The cells contain slightly enlarged, hyperchromatic nuclei with punctuate, variably sized nucleoli.  There is cellular crowding with occasional mitotic figures.  The findings are felt to indicate the presence of glandular cancer consistent with a lung primary.

Principle  HER-2/neu FISH testing is performed in compliance with the ASCO/CAP guidelines. The procedure in use has been modified from the FDA approved procedure (PathVysion from Vysis) by increasing the enzyme digestion to 20 minutes and using DAPI II as a counterstain.  The Flow Cytometry Laboratory takes responsibility for test performance, and the validation performed has proven extremely high between IHC and FISH.  Tissue sections are deparaffinized, pretreated and digested, then probed and incubated overnight, along with appropriate controls.  Two separate probes are used from Vysis:  a Spectrum Orange Her-2 probe that is locus-specific and a Spectrum Green centromere probe for Chromosome 17.  The slides are counterstained with DAPI to produce an enhanced visualization of probe reactivity.  Analysis  The slides are viewed under a fluorescent microscope. The level of HER-2 gene amplification is measured as a ratio of orange (Her-2) fluorescent foci to green (CEP 17) fluorescent foci. A positive result is a ratio >2.2, and a negative result is a ratio <1.8.  A ratio between 1.8-2.2 is considered equivocal amplification.  References   1) Wolff A.C. et al.

Due to the cautery artifact, the\nmorphology of these glands cannot be well discerned. A triple stain was\nattempted, and while there is no definite differential staining to suggest\na basal layer, due to the cautery artifact, interpretation is not\ndefinitive. This may represent a microscopic focus of malignant epithelial tumor; however\nthis interpretation is inideterminate.\n\nINTRAOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:\nFSA:  Bladder neck:  Negative for tumor.  (XX)\nGROSS DESCRIPTION:  Number of specimen containers: 4.  Labeled with patient\nname: **NAME[AAA BBB], MRN: **ID-NUM.\nA.   Container designation: \"Bladder neck\" --  The specimen consists of\nthree tan-pink fragments of tissue measuring 1.2 x 0.6 x 0.3, 0.5 x 0.4 x\n0.3 and 0.3 x 0.2 x 0.2 cm.  The fragments are submitted for frozen now\nentirely for permanent in A1.\nB.  Container designation: \"Ileal obturator lymph nodes\" --  The specimen\nconsists of a 4 x 3.2 x 1.1 cm fragment of fibroadipose tissue.  Careful\npalpation of the tissue reveals a single 1.1 cm presumed lymph node which\nis bisected and submitted entirely in B1.  The remainder of the tissue is\nsubmitted in B2 and B3.\nC.  Container designation: \"Right obturator lymph node\" --  The specimen\nconsists of a single fragment of fibroadipose tissue measuring 3.2 x 1.7 x\n0.8 cm.  The specimen is carefully palpated with no definitive lymph nodes\nidentified.  Possible lymph nodes are submitted whole in C1.  The remainder\nof the tissue is submitted in C2 and C3.\nD.  Container designation: \"Prostate\" --  The specimen consists of a 45 gm\nradical prostatectomy specimen measuring 3.5 cm from apex to base, 4.8 cm\nlaterally and 3.2 cm anterior posteriorly.  The urethra is probe patent.\nThe posterior bladder surface is smooth and intact.  The anterior and basal\nsurface have prominent cautery artifact.  Also attached are bilateral vas\ndeferentia and seminal vesicles.  The prostate has a firm spongy\nconsistency and is vaguely nodular.  The exterior surface of the prostate\nis differentially inked as follows: left anterior   blue, left posterior\ngreen, right anterior   black, right posterior   red.  The prostate has\nbeen serially sectioned from apex to base revealing multiple yellow-tan\nsmall lumps imbedded in a pink tan stroma.  The small lumps are present in all\nquadrants of the prostate.  There is no grossly apparent extension beyond\nthe prostatic parenchyma, however a prominent portion is present within 0.1\ncm of the inked posterior margin in the mid prostate.  Cassette summary: D1\nand D2   right and left apex, respectively (level one), D3 and D4   right\nand left level two, D5 and D6   right and left level three, D7 and D8\nposterior right and left level six, D9 and D10   lateral right and left\nlevel five, D11   left insertion of seminal vesicle into prostate base, D12\n  left representative vas deferens and seminal vesicle, D13   right seminal\nvesicle insertion into prostate base, D14   representative right vas and\nseminal vesicle, D15   right and left prostate base.\n\n(Dictated by: **NAME[ZZZ YYY], MD)\nMICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION: Histologic examination performed.\n\nThe staff pathologist was present during the formal review and\ninterpretation of all slides and ancillary studies, (if performed), with\nthe medical student or resident.\n\n\n\n**NAME[XXX WWW], MD\nPathologist\nElectronically signed **DATE[Dec 08 2012] 10:57 AM\nSPECIMENS SUBMITTED:\nA.

The findings will be reported in an addendum.  Preliminary findings were discussed with Dr. **NAME[ZZZ YYY] on **DATE[Oct 22 2011].\nGrossDescription:\nReceived in formalin, labeled \"right colon\" is a segment of small bowel (12 cm in length by 3.5 cm in diameter) and a segment of large bowel (15 cm in length by 4 cm in diameter).  A smooth tan appendix (6.9 x 0.7 x 0.6 cm) is attached to the cecum of the large bowel.  The serosa of the small and large bowel are smooth, tan-red.  The proximal and distal resection surgical borders are stapled.  The staples are removed and the revised proximal and distal resection surgical borders are inked black.  The radial resection margin is also inked black.  The specimen is opened to reveal tan mucosa.  Two possible tan growth protruding from a mucous membranes (0.2 x 0.2 x 0.1 cm and 0.3 x 0.2 x 0.1 cm) are found in the large bowel located 9 cm and 8 cm away from the distal resection margin, respectively.  A large firm mass causes a complete obstruction at the ileocecal junction (5 x 4 x 4 cm).  Upon sectioning the obstructed area reveals a firm and fibrous tan-yellow submucosal mass (approximately 3.5 x 3 x 3 cm) located at the ileocecal junction and at the base of the appendix.  The mass grossly approaches 11 cm within the proximal resection margin, 13.5 cm within the distal resection margin, 3 cm within the radial resection margin and grossly appears to extend to the serosal surface.  Representative sections are submitted as follows:\n\nBlock Summary:\n1)  -  Perpendicular section of proximal resection margin.\n2)  -  Perpendicular section of distal resection margin.\n3)  -  En face section of radial resection margin.\n4)  -  Section of proximal end of appendix.\n5)  -  Additional cross sections of appendix.\n6)  -  Section of distal tip of appendix.\n7)  -  Two possible growth protruding from a mucous membranes found in large bowel.\n8)  -  Section of mass with base of appendix.\n9-16)  -  Additional sections of submucosal mass.\n17)  -  Section of mass with growth protruding from a mucous membraneoid obstruction.\n18)  -  Sections of grossly normal small bowel proximal from the mass.\n19)  -  Sections of grossly normal large bowel distal from the mass. \n20)  -  Six possible lymph nodes.\n21)  -  Six possible lymph nodes.\n22)  -  Six possible lymph nodes.\n23)  -  Six possible lymph nodes.\n24)  -  Six possible lymph nodes.\n25)  -  Six possible lymph nodes.\n26)  -  Six possible lymph nodes.\n27)  -  Six possible lymph nodes.\n28)  -  Three possible lymph nodes.\n29)  -  One possible lymph node.\nMicroscopicDescription:\nThe microscopic findings support the diagnosis.\nA: Right colon\nAddendumComment:\nIn addition to the one lymph node noted in the initial report to be involved with malignant epithelial tumor by direct extension, one other node shows 7 PCK positive tumor cells in the subcapsular sinus (positive for isolated tumor cells).  The PCK stain was examined after the initial report was generated.  The presence if isolated tumor cells in this other lymph node is of uncertain clinical significance.\n"

In non-small cell lung\ncancer, this type of activating EGFR mutation is reported to correlate with\nresponsiveness to anti-EGFR tyrosine kinase therapy. This real time PCR assay\nhas been validated to identify the most common EGFR tyrosine kinase domain\nmutations that involve exons 18-21. This test is validated for non-small cell\nlung malignant epithelial tumor. The clinical significance and use of this assay in other tumor\ntypes is not well characterized. Note that this assay is not intended to\ndiagnose any particular type of cancer, but as an aid to clinicians, is\nintended to be used as an adjunct to other prognostic factors to select\neligible patients for therapy. (**NAME[ZZZ:YYY] et al., NEJM 2004;**ID-NUM, Mok\net al., NEJM 2009; **ID-NUM, Pao et al., JClinOnc 2005; **ID-NUM).\nMATERIAL RECEIVED\nA1 = ***PATH-NUMBER[1], B1, 1 Block (**DATE[Apr 10 2012])\nPROCEDURE DATE\n**DATE[Apr 09 2012]\nCLIENT REQUEST / CLINICAL HISTORY\nEGFR by PCR \nEGFR PCR METHODS\nThis real time PCR test (Qiagen/DxS) detects the most common activating\nmutations in EGFR, which have been identified in human lung non-small cell\ncancer involving codons 18-21, and leading to the following types of\nmutations: exon 19 deletions (detects any of 19 deletions but does not\ndistinguish between the types), L858R, L861Q, G719X (detects G719S, G719A, and\nG719C, but does not distinguish between the types), S768I, and exon 20\ninsertions (detects any of 3 insertions but does not distinguish between the\ntypes). These mutations account for the vast majority of all activating EGFR\nmutations. Using control materials that contain the L858R and exon 19\ndeletions, which account for ~86% of known EGFR activating mutations, this\nassay has been validated to detect these mutations at a level of 1%. Purified\ngenomic DNA is extracted from microdissected tumor specimen, is analyzed by\nlow volume spectrophotometry, and then used as sample DNA in a real time PCR\nassay using fluorescently labeled and non-labeled primers to detect wild-type\nand mutated EGFR. Sample delta Ct values for mutant and control reactions are\ncalculated and compared against threshold delta Ct values in each mutant\nreaction to determine the presence of each individual mutation type. Negative\nand positive controls are assayed with each sample. The assay sensitivity is\nestimated to be ~1% tumor involvement for each mutation type detected. \nMETHOD LIMITATIONS: Tumor samples are non-homogeneous and data from a sample\nof tumor may not be concordant with data from other sections of the same\ntumor. Tumor samples may also contain non-tumor tissue, and DNA from these\nareas would not be expected to contain a EGFR mutation. Although this assay\nproduces short PCR products, it may not work on heavily fragmented DNA. In\ninstances where the frequency of a target mutation is very low with respect to\nthe wild-type background (<1%), this assay may fail to detect the mutation,\nleading to a false-negative result.     \n    Electronically signed **DATE[Apr 14 2012]: **NAME[XXX WWW], MD-Pathologist\n M.D., Pathologist\nPer CMS regulations, the pathologist's signature above indicates that this\ncase has been reviewed and the diagnosis made or confirmed by said\npathologist.\nNote: Some of the tests reported here may have been developed and performance\ncharacteristics determined by PhenoPath Laboratories. They have not been\ncleared or approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). However,\nthe FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary.\nPursuant to the requirements of CLIA, this laboratory has established and\nverified the accuracy and precision of all tests, and additional information\nabout these tests is available upon request.

There is no significant expression for CD7, CD14 (Mo2), CD34, and CD117.  \n\nThe overall findings are interpreted as showing a CD33 positive acute myeloid blood cancer with monocytic features.\n\nThis test has not been cleared or approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, but the FDA does not require this test to go through premarket FDA review.  **INSTITUTION Pathology Laboratory, which is regulated under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA) as qualified to perform high complexity clinical testing, has developed this test's performance characteristics.

Received fresh, previously opened and unoriented, labeled \"XXXXXX, **NAME[AAA], sigmoid colon\" is an unoriented segment of pink-tan, intestinal tissue measuring up to 13.5 cm in length x 9.0 cm in greatest circumference. There is a well-circumscribed, centrally ulcerated and necrotic tumor measuring 5.3 x 4.2 x 0.5 cm.  The tumor is approximately 2.7 cm away from one margin, which has been inked blue, and approximately 5.5 cm away from the opposite margin, which has been inked orange.  The mass is nearly circumferential.  The underlying fat and serosal surface is inked black beneath the tumor.  Sectioning of the tumor reveals that it penetrates through the muscularis propria and does extend to the serosa and fat.  There are two suspicious, shaggy-appearing areas at the blue margin.  Examination of the fat reveals multiple lymph nodes, ranging from 0.7 cm to 0.2 cm in greatest dimension.  \n\n  KEY TO CASSETTES:\n  A1    -  Orange shave margin\n  A2    -  Blue shave margin and one perpendicular representative section of the margin\n  A3-A7    -  Tumor and deepest penetrating area through the serosa\n  A8-A10    -  Tumor and extension into the fat\n  A11, A12  -  Shaggy area #1\n  A13, A14  -  Shaggy area #2\n  A15    -  Three lymph nodes\n  A16    -  Three lymph nodes\n  A17    -  Two lymph nodes\n  A18    -  One lymph node (trisected)\n  A19    -  One lymph node\n  A20    -  Two lymph nodes\n  A21    -  Three lymph nodes\n  A22    -  Two lymph nodes \n\n        Lymph nodes within cassettes within A15-A19 are lymph nodes underlying the tumor, and lymph nodes in cassettes A20-A22 \n        are lymph nodes present closer to the orange-inked margin.  \n\nB.

Within the desmoplastic stroma are scattered round to oval cells which stain positively with both cytokeratin AE1/AE3 (establishing an epithelial origin) and estrogen receptor (ER).  The findings are consistent with metastatic lobular malignant epithelial tumor.  The immunohistochemical stains were performed on sections of the decalcified, formalin-fixed, and paraffin-embedded bone tissue sampling; all controls react appropriately.  Of note, the small amount of residual background marrow that is present demonstrates trilineage hematopoiesis.\n\nIntradepartmental consultation with Dr. **NAME[ZZZ YYY] on **DATE[Oct 14 12].

The small lump measures approximately 1.2 x 0.7 x 0.6 cm. in greatest dimensions.  The external surface is marked with black ink.  The specimen is sectioned and submitted in toto in A. The thyroid lobe weighs 5 grams and measures 4.2 x 2.5 x 1.2 cm. in greatest dimensions. There is a defect near one pole.  The external surface is brown-gray and slightly irregular. On sectioning, near the opposite pole of the defect is seen a round white oval structure measuring approximately 0.7 cm. in diameter.  The remainder of the cut surface of the thyroid is reddish-brown and granular.  Representative sections are submitted in B-E with the white small lump in B-D.           PATHOLOGY REPORT   \\T\\a9.3L   \nMICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION   Sections consist of segments of thyroid gland within which is seen a focus of classical type papillary thyroid malignant epithelial tumor.  Tumor cells in papillary-like formations and have enlarged round nuclei with nuclear clearing and numerous linear grooves.  The tumor extends through a thick capsule into the surrounding non-cancerous thyroid tissue.  In one area is seen a small individual malignant acini several millimeters from the tumor.  The tumor extends to within less than 1 mm of the surgical margin focally.  Maximum tumor size is 1 cm.  Lymphovascular invasion is not identified.  Extrathyroidal extension is not noted.   A second smaller 3 mm diameter tumor is noted in the thyroid consisting of a Hurthle cell adenoma.   The second separately received segment of thyroid gland appears to be that of a non-cancerous adenoma. \nSPECIMEN   RIGHT LOBE THYROID --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------     --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                   PATHOLOGY REPORT\n"

Container designation: \"left kidney and adrenal gland\"   The specimen\nconsists of a left kidney and adrenal gland weighing in total 650 gm and\nmeasuring 21 x 14 x 8 cm.  The surrounding perirenal fat varies in\nthickness from 1 to 3 cm.  Extending from the renal pelvis is a ureter (7.5\ncm in length, 0.3 cm in diameter) renal artery (1.5 cm in length, 0.6 cm in\ndiameter) and renal vein (1.0 cm in length, 1.1 cm in diameter).  The\nureter, renal artery and renal vein are all opened to reveal patent lumens\nwith no grossly visible involvement of tumor.  Located primarily in the\nlower pole is a 6.9 x 5.9 x 5.5 diffuse, poorly circumscribed golden yellow\ntumor without areas of tissue death.  The tumor pushes against the renal\ncapsule and in areas appears to possibly penetrate the capsule and invade\ninto the perirenal fat, but tumor is not present at the deep surgical\nmargin. The tumor does not appear to invade into the ureter, renal artery\nor renal vein.  The remainder of the renal cortex is brown with a\nwell-defined cortico-medullary junction.  The renal pelvis and calices are\ncovered with smooth glistening mucosa.  The adrenal gland consists of\nnormal medulla and cortex without focal lesions.  Representative cassettes\nare submitted as follows:  A1   surgical borders of ureter, renal vein and renal\nartery; A2   adrenal gland; A3-A5   renal capsule and perirenal fat with\narea of possible tumor penetration through the capsule in A3; A6-A7   tumor\nand adjacent hilar fat; A8   tumor adjacent to normal-appearing parenchyma;\nA9   additional section of tumor; A10   normal-appearing parenchyma.\n\n(Dictated by: **NAME[YYY XXX], MD)\nMICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION: Histologic examination performed.\n\nThe staff pathologist was present during the formal review and\ninterpretation of all slides and ancillary studies, (if performed), with\nthe medical student or resident.\n\n\n\n**NAME[WWW VVV], MD\nPathologist\nElectronically signed **DATE[Apr 02 2012] 05:24 PM\nSPECIMENS SUBMITTED:\nA.

As this case demonstrates 2+ staining for HER-2/neu, HER-2/neu by FISH will be performed and an addendum will be issued once the study is complete.  \n_____________________________________________________________________\nImmunohistochemical evaluation is performed by manual quantitative/semiquantitative morphometric analysis.\nImmunohistochemical evaluation of estrogen receptor is performed is using DAKO monoclonal  mouse antihuman estrogen receptor alpha clone 1D5.  Progesterone receptor evaluation is performed using DAKO monoclonal mouse antihuman progesterone receptor clone PgR636.  Ki-67 evaluation is performed using DAKO monoclonal mouse antihuman  Ki-67 antigen clone MIB-1.  Her-2 neu evaluation is performed using DAKO polyclonal rabbit antihuman c-erbB-2 oncoprotein code No. A 0485.  Unless otherwise indicated, these studies are performed using the DAKO auto stainer used with paraffin embedded formalin-fixed sections which have undergone heat-induced epitope retrieval in Target Retrieval Solution.  DAKO Envision+/HRP kit is used for visualization.\n*  If less than 1% of tumor cells are positive for estrogen or progesterone receptor, the tumor is considered to be negative for hormone receptor expression per ASCO-CAP 2010 guidelines.\n**  A false negative cannot be ruled out in the presence of inadequate controls.\n*** Negative (0) - no staining or membrane staining < 10% tumor cells.\n   Negative (1+) - faint partial membrane staining > 10% tumor cells.\n   Weak positive (2+) - weak to moderate complete membrane staining > 10% tumor cells.\n   Strong positive (3+) -  uniform intense complete membrane staining > 30% tumor cells.\n****  When discordance exists between cell proliferation as determined by ki-67 antigen and histologic mitotic count, the           \nhigher of the two determinations should be used.  Ki-67 antigen is sensitive to tissue fixation and may show a falsely low  proliferation index.\n\n\n<ADDENDUM>\nIMMUNOCYTOCHEMICAL CANCER MARKER STUDIES REPORT\nESTROGEN RECEPTOR:    POSITIVE\n*Percent cells positive:  98%\nStaining intensity:     Strong\n  Internal Controls:    Positive\nPROGESTERONE RECEPTOR:  POSITIVE\n  *Percent cells positive:  48%\n  Staining intensity:         Weak\n  Internal Controls:    Positive\nCerbB2 (HER-2 NEU) ONCOGENE OVEREXPRESSION:  \n          INDETERMINATE\n  ***Score:        2+ (32% of cells demonstrate moderate membranous\n            staining).\n  Internal Controls:    Present\nKi-67 Antigen:****      Low (<10%)\n  \nPercent cells positive:    3%, HER-2 by FISH was performed at PhenoPath Laboratories and was found to be negative for gene amplification.

The greatest radiographic dimension noted was 1.2 cm.  Clinical correlation is recommended. HER-2/neu (c-erbB-2) Immunohistochemistry Using appropriate positive and negative controls, the test for the presence of this oncoprotein is performed by the immunoperoxidase method, and reported according to the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO)/College of American Pathologists (CAP) Guideline Recommendations (2006). IMMUNOHISTOCHEMICAL INTERPRETATION:  CELL MEMBRANE STAINING ONLY (DAKO Polyclonal Rabbit Anti-Human c-erB-2 Oncoprotein Antibody) NEGATIVE:  Score 0 (No staining is observed or membrane staining is observed in less than 10% of the tumor cells). NEGATIVE:  Score 1+ (A faint/barely perceptible membrane staining is seen in more than 10% of the tumor cells.  The cells are only stained in part of their membrane). WEAK POSITIVE:  Score 2+ (A weak to moderate complete membrane staining is observed in more than 10% of the tumor cells). STRONG POSITIVE:  Score 3+ (A strong complete membrane staining is observed in more than 30% of the tumor cells). The results of this test are for investigational purposes as its performance characteristics have not been established.  It should be noted that according to the literature, the sensitivity for immunohistochemical HER-2/neu determination is no greater than 80% when compared to molecular or FISH methods. Primary antibody:  C-erb B.2 oncoprotein (polyclonal rabbit Dako ID# A0485) Detection system:  Dakocytoenvision (+) R System HRP (DAB) The immunohistochemical test(s) were developed and the performance characteristics determined by the **INSTITUTION Pathology.  It has not been cleared or approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.  The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary.  This test is used for clinical purposes.

FISH\nfor t(15;17) is in progress, as is cytogenetic analysis, and will be\nreported separately.  As blast percentages in bone marrow specimens are\naltered by hemodilution and lysis of red blood cell precursors, the blast\npercentage may not be accurate and is best determined by morphologic\nevaluation. Correlation with the bone marrow morphology and clinical\nfindings is required for complete interpretation of the findings.\n\nThe results were discussed with Dr. **NAME[ZZZ] on **DATE[Oct 30 11].\n\nMORPHOLOGY:\nThe cytospin preparation shows a prominent population of intermediate to\nlarge sized blasts. The intermediate sized blasts have a high nuclear to\ncytoplasmic ratio, fine nuclear chromatin, and moderately abundant\ncytoplasm. The larger cells have irregular nuclear contours, prominent\nnucleoli, and more abundant granulated cytoplasm with an appearance most\nsuggestive of neoplastic promyelocytes (blast equivalents).  Auer rods are\npresent with more than one Auer rod detected in some cells.\n\nFLOW CYTOMETRY:\nViability:  80%\nThe following antigens were examined: CD3  CD4  CD7  CD8  CD10  CD13  CD14\nCD15  CD19  CD20  CD33  CD34  CD36  CD45  CD56  CD64  CD117  HLA-DR  kappa\nlambda\n\nBlasts:\nIncreased blasts identified, see comment above.  Approximately 5% of cells\nexpress CD34. The blasts do not express CD19, CD10, CD4, CD14, CD36, or\nCD15.\n\nLymphoid population:\nPolytypic B-cells account for 1% of total events and have a normal\nkappa:lambda light chain ratio of 1.6:1.\n\nApproximately 11% of total events are mature T-cells with a normal CD4:CD8\nratio of 1.5:1 and normal pan T-cell antigen expression with the antibodies\nexamined.\n\nMyeloid/monocyte populations:\nA minority of recorded events (6%) are CD33 positive maturing myeloid\ncells.\n\n\nIf images are listed within this report, they can be viewed by authorized\nusers on **WEB-LOC, Pathology Express.\n\nThis test was developed and its performance characteristics determined by\nXXXXX.  It has not been cleared or approved by the\nU.S. Food and Drug Administration.  The FDA has determined that such\nclearance or approval is not necessary.  This test is used for clinical\npurposes.

Specimen one is received fresh for frozen section diagnosis and is labeled \\\"right fallopian tube and ovary\\\" and consists of the aforementioned weighing 60.5 grams and measuring 7 x 4 x 6 cm in greatest dimension.  There is a purple-tan fluid-filled sacic structure extruding from a more firm pink-tan area measuring 3 cm in diameter and another pedunculated area of small fluid-filled sacic structures and firm areas extends on a thread of connective tissue which is 3 cm long and measures itself 3 x 2 x 1 cm.  An attached portion of fallopian tube is present measuring 8 cm in length by 1.5 cm in greatest diameter.  The serosal surface is inked in black and the specimen is sectioned to reveal a firm yellow-tan parenchyma containing multiple simple fluid-filled sacic spaces without excrescences and some hemorrhagic-filled fluid-filled sacic structures as well.  Representative sections are submitted from the varying architectural areas as 1FS-1 and 1FS-2.  The previously frozen 1FS-1 and 1FS-2 are entirely resubmitted as such and sections from the unfrozen tissue are submitted in cassettes A-C. Specimen two is labeled \\\"right internal iliac obturator\\\" and consists of a cluster of fibro-fatty tissue.  The total cluster measures 3 x 2.5 x 0.3 cm.  The entire cluster is fibro-fatty.  No true lymph nodes are seen.  The entire cluster is submitted in cassettes labeled 2A and 2B. Specimen three is labeled \\\"external commons\\\" and consists of two clusters of fibro-fatty rubbery tissue.  The total cluster measures 3 x 2 x 0.3 cm.  The specimen is sectioned and shows more fat.  Very little lymphoid material is identified, if any.  All of the tissue is submitted in one cassette labeled 3. Specimen four is labeled \\\"right common and periaortic\\\" and consists of a red-tan fragment of tissue.  The total cluster measures 2.5 x 1 x 0.3 cm.  The cluster of tissue is submitted in one cassette labeled 4. Specimen five is labeled \\\"left internal opturator\\\" and consists of a triangle of fibro-fatty rubbery tissue measuring 3 x 2.5 x 0.3 cm.  The specimen is sectioned and shows lymphoid material.  The entire cluster of lymphoid material and adjacent structures are submitted in one cassette labeled 5A. Specimen six is labeled \\\"left common and periaortic\\\" and consists of a cluster of fatty tissue.  No lymphoid material is seen.  The total cluster measures 2.5 x 2 x 0.3 cm.  All fragments are submitted in one cassette labeled 6A. Specimen seven is labeled \\\"left external iliac commons\\\" and consists of fibro-fatty irregular rubbery tissue.  The total cluster in two parts with one measuring 0.5 cm and the other measuring 1 x 0.3 cm.  Both fragments are submitted in one cassette labeled 7A. Specimen eight is labeled \\\"omentum\\\" and consists of a lace-like pattern of fatty tissue compatible with omentum which has a measurement of 8 x 4 x 0.5 cm.  Sections made perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of this portion of omentum show lobules of fatty tissue.  No lymph nodes are seen by gross inspection.  Representative sections are submitted in one cassette labeled 8A. Specimen nine is labeled \\\"cervix, uterus, left tube and left ovarie\\\" and consists of a uterus with attached ovary, left.  The uterus includes endocervical canal and a portion of the cervix.  The specimen weighs 370 grams and has a measurement of 13 cm and a width of 10 cm and a thickness of 7.2 cm.  The left ovary is tubular and cylindrical shaped and measures 6 x 2 x 2.2 cm.  The fallopian tube measures 6 cm. Greatest diameter of the ovary 5 cm.  The fimbriated end appears satisfactory.  The uterus is sectioned from the anterior posterior plane sagittally and shows a thickening and mass effect of the posterior central portion of the body of uterus.  The specimen is allowed adequate fixation prior to further section in order to preserve the tumor and the extent of tumor that might be present and degree of invasion.  The serosal surface of both these portions of the uterus is intact, smooth and uninvolved by tumor. The uterus is sectioned sagittally and now shows a satisfactory fixation process.  The left ovary and fallopian tube measures 5 x 2 cm.  The ovary is sectioned and shows well-fixed pink-tan stromal process.  Cystic follicles are present along the subcordical surface of this process.  A section of this ovary is submitted in one cassette.  A section of the fimbriated fallopian tube segment measures 5 x 1 cm.  Section is submitted in cassette labeled 9B.  No tumor is seen in these sections.  Sections of the site of the attachment of the ovary and the fallopian tube are submitted in one cassette labeled 9C.  No tumor is seen by gross inspection at this focus.  The sagittally sectioned body of the uterus is now sectioned perpendicular to the transverse axis and shows a superficial process of tumor on the endometrial surface.  A section of this process is submitted in cassette labeled 9D.  The process extends into the lower uterine segment.  A section from the lower uterine segment of the body of the uterus is submitted in cassette labeled 9E.  The process does not extend to the cervix.  Sections of the anterior and posterior lip of the cervix are submitted in cassette labeled 9F.  No tumor is seen in this extension either.  The opposite half of the body of the uterus is sectioned perpendicular to the longitudinal axis and shows the tumor size to be 1.5 cm.  The body of the uterus measures 3.7 cm from the base of the tumor.  A section showing the tumor and this involvement of the superficial portion of the endometrium reveal an extension of the tumor.  A section showing the superficial area of the tumor is submitted in cassette labeled 9G.  A section of the extent of tumor into the wall of the uterus is submitted in cassette labeled 9H.  The tumor extends on this particular focus a distance of 3 cm and the myometrium residual without tumor involvement is 1.2 cm at this focus. The serosal surface is free of metastatic disease.  Another section of the tumor that is well fixed showing the deep margin of resection of this tumor adjacent to a portion of the softened poorly fixed area is submitted in cassettes labeled 9I and 9J.\nMICROSCOPIC HISTOLOGIC TYPE: Endometrioid glandular cancer, not otherwise characterized TUMOR GRADE: FIGO grade 1 MYOMETRIAL INVASION: Present Depth of invasion: 0.2 cm Myometrial thickness: 3.7 cm INVOLVEMENT OF CERVIX: Not involved EXTENT OF INVOLVEMENT OF OTHER ORGANS RIGHT OVARY: Not involved LEFT OVARY: Not involved RIGHT FALLOPIAN TUBE: Not involved LEFT FALLOPIAN TUBE: Not involved SURGICAL BORDERS: Uninvolved by infiltrating cancer malignant epithelial tumor LYMPH-VASCULAR INVASION: Not identified PATHOLOGIC CLASSIFICATION OF CANCER EXTENT (pT1apN0) PRIMARY TUMOR: pT1a REGIONAL LYMPH NODES: pN0 Pelvic lymph nodes Number examined: 7 Number involved: 0 Para-aortic lymph nodes: Number examined: 2 Number involved: 0 DISTANT SPREAD OF CANCER: Not applicable ADDITIONAL PATHOLOGIC FINDINGS Complex excessive cell growth CLINICAL HISTORY Stein-Leventhal Syndrome ANCILLARY STUDIES (Cytology performed in interpreted at P\\T\\C Laboratories) CYTOLOGY RESULTS (11-PM-25) See separate outside report PELVIC WASHING:  Negative for malignant cells.

Section 2B shows four lymph node structures with non-cancerous lymphoid structures, sinus histiocytosis and no tumor seen. Sections of the lymph nodes, external common, 3A-1, show non-cancerous lymphoid structures, congestion and no malignant features seen. Negative lymphoid structures present. Sections of the lymph nodes, right common and para-aortic, 4A-1, show non-cancerous lymphoid structures, reactive changes, sinus histiocytosis.  No metastatic tumor is identified.  Multiple sections of lymph nodes are present.  A total of six (6) lymph nodes are present and no tumor is seen. Sections of the left internal obturator, 5A-1, show a total of seven (7) lymph node fragments are present and show non-cancerous lymphoid structures with no tumor present.  Sinus histiocytosis is noted.  No malignant features are seen. Sections of the left common and para-aortic node, 6A-1, show non-cancerous fibro-fatty tissue.  No lymphoid structures are present. Sections of the left external iliac commons, 7A-1, show non-cancerous lymphoid structures with sinus histiocytosis.  No metastatic tumor is identified.  Vessels, fatty tissue and clotted blood are present.  No tumor is seen.  A total of one (1) lymph node is present in levels present.  No tumor is seen. Sections of the omentum, 8A-1, show non-cancerous fibro-fatty tissue compatible with omentum. Sections of the uterus, left ovary and tube, 9A-1, show non-cancerous ovarian structures and no tumor seen.  No malignant features are present. Section 9B-1 shows a fallopian tube with no tumor seen.  Section 9C-1 shows a round ligament, associated tissue and a portion of the fallopian tube with no evidence of tumor present in this focus.  This is near the attachment site of the ovary and fallopian tube.  Section 9D-1 shows ovarian stroma and non-cancerous strands of endometrial glands and stroma scattered throughout the nodular process of myometrium.  Some focal cytological atypia is seen but no glandular cancer is seen in this section.  Section 9E-1 shows lower uterine segment of the body of the uterus.   This shows endometrial glands and stroma with simple fluid-filled sacic excessive cell growth , branching complexity appreciated.  No cytological atypia is seen in this focus.  Section 9F-1 shows cervical epithelium with no tumor present.  Endocervical glands are also present showing excessive cell growth with no atypical features identified.  Section 9G-1 shows a well-differentiated endometrioid glandular cancer.  Some tissue death is present.  Back-to-back glands with tubular structures and glandular structures showing tissue death and also well-differentiated glandular cancer, endometrioid variety, arising in the endometrial surface with extension into the wall.  Section 9H-1 shows extent of the tumor into the wall of the uterus.  This specimen shows proliferation of endometrium, glandular structures and no malignant features seen.  Section 9I-1 shows back-to-back glands, well differentiated small lumps of endometrial tissue with tumor present. Minimal tissue death is noted.  Section 9J-1 shows clusters of well differentiated tumor scattered throughout the entire section.

Left breast mass:  \n\nBreast Tumor Information:\n\nType of specimen(s):  Left breast tissue sampling\nHistologic Type:  Ductal malignant epithelial tumor-in-situ, see comment\nSize:  High grade abnormal cell growth and in-situ malignant epithelial tumor extend over an area estimated at 1.3 cm in greatest dimension\nArchitectural pattern(s):  Predominantly solid\nNuclear grade:  Nuclear grade 3 out of 3\nNecrosis:  Not identified\nMicrocalcifications:  Not identified\nResection surgical borders:  Margins free of in-situ ductal malignant epithelial tumor\nAdditional findings:  Receptor studies requested.\nDiagnosisComment:\nThe specimen is removed at 15:55 on **DATE[Aug 7 2011] and placed in formalin at 16:28 on **DATE[Aug 7 2011].  It is submitted for processing to begin at 10:30 pm on **DATE[Aug 8 2011].\n\nPlease correlate with prior tissue sampling.\n\nADDENDUM:  Outside slides from initial core needle tissue sampling (***PATH-NUMBER[1]) shows definite infiltrating cancer ductal malignant epithelial tumor.  Dr. **NAME[ZZZ] has reviewed both the initial core needle tissue sampling and the excisional tissue sampling.\nGrossDescription:\nA.  Node, left axilla:  Received fresh for frozen section is a fatty lymph node.  On section, it is grossly free of tumor.  Touch preps are performed:  NO EVIDENCE OF METASTATIC MALIGNANT EPITHELIAL TUMOR.  DLW 3:30 pm.  Specimen submitted for permanent sections.\n \nB.  Left breast mass:  Received is a fatty breast tissue sampling measuring up to 9 x 7 x 2.5 cm.  The specimen is oriented with a double suture, a single suture, and a wire.  The specimen is roughly pancake in shape.  The double suture is located on the superficial aspect of the tissue sampling (inked red).  The opposite bottom aspect is inked green.  A single suture is located at one medial edge (inked black) and the opposite edge is (inked blue).  The wire is located 90 degrees from the single suture.  This edge is (inked yellow) and the edge opposite to the wire is (inked orange).  On section, an ill-defined area of hemorrhagic discoloration extends over an area of 2 cm in greatest dimension.  The closest surgical margin is inked green.  Representative sections submitted through cassette B9.\nMicroscopicDescription:\nA.  Node, left axilla:  Sections of the lymph node are free of metastatic malignant epithelial tumor.  Cytokeratin stains are also negative for metastatic malignant epithelial tumor.\n \nB.  Left breast mass:  Slides B8 and B9 demonstrate areas suggestive of a prior tissue sampling with granulation tissue formation, inflammation, scarring process, and bleeding.  The adjacent stroma demonstrates a duct with in-situ ductal malignant epithelial tumor and comedotissue death as well as a few small nests in which a clear myoepithelial layer is not appreciated on H and E stain.  However on myosin staining, these nests do demonstrate a myoepithelial layer.  Nuclei appear high grade.  Throughout this section as well as much of the remainder of the sampled breast, there is evidence of fat tissue death.  Slide B2 also demonstrates areas of high grade ductal malignant epithelial tumor-in-situ as well as a few nests of infiltrating cancer ductal malignant epithelial tumor.  Definite vascular or neural invasion is not appreciated.\nA: Node, left axilla\nB: Left breast mass\nAddendumDiagnosis:\nPROGNOSTIC PANEL SUMMARY\n\n\nEstrogen receptor (clone 1D5):    Positive\nProgesterone receptor (clone PgR 636):  Negative\nHER-2/neu (HercepTest):      Equivocal\n\n\nFormalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections, see image analysis report for complete analytic results.\n\nHER-2/neu (FISH):  Positive for amplification.\nAddendumComment:\nHER-2/neu analysis by fluorescence localized tumor hybridization shows a HER-2/chromosome 17 ratio of 3.3.\n\n\nTesting performed at Clarient Diagnostic Services, **PLACE, CA.\n"

Per outside report (**ID-NUM), immunohistochemistry stains were performed on the tissue sampling from **DATE[Mar 19 2012] and the tumor is negative for estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor and Her-2.  Ki-67 demonstrated a high proliferative index of >50%.\n\n<GROSS>\nReceived in formalin, labeled with the patient's name and designated 'left breast tissue, short suture at Tail of **NAME[ZZZ], long suture marks tumor skin boundary,' is a 160 gm simple left mastectomy specimen with short suture designating Tail of **NAME[ZZZ] and long suture marking tumor skin boundary, per the requisition.  The breast measures 9.1 cm from superior to inferior, 2.5 cm from anterior to posterior, 15.3 cm from medial to lateral.  A tan-pink skin ellipse is present on the anterior surface measuring 13.8 cm from medial to lateral x 8.1 cm from superior to inferior.  A V-shaped incision is present on the left tip of the skin ellipse, which measures 7.2 cm from superior to inferior, and is located 1.5 cm from the most lateral skin tip.  An everted nipple measuring 1.1 cm in diameter x 0.9 cm in length is located in the central aspect of the skin, with a 3.1 cm areolar surrounding the nipple.  The specimen is differentially inked to allow for the microscopic evaluation of surgical removal of tissue surgical borders as follows:  anterior-superior resection margin   blue, anterior-inferior resection margin   green, and posterior resection margin   black.  Sectioning reveals a firm, round, well-circumscribed mass measuring 1.5 cm from medial to lateral, 1.3 cm from superior to inferior, and 1.3 cm from anterior to posterior.  The mass is located 0.1 cm from the closest black-inked posterior resection margin, 0.9 cm from the closest blue-inked anterior-superior resection margin, 2.0 cm from the closest green-inked anterior-inferior resection margin, 0.8 cm deep to the skin, and 7.0 cm from the nipple.  The mass is located in the lower-outer quadrant.  The mass has a tan-white homogeneous and rubbery cut surface.  The mass is located 0.9 cm deep to the skin incision.  Located 1.0 cm from the mass is an ill-defined small lump area of tan-white dense fibrous tissue, measuring 2.5 x 1.0 x 1.0 cm.  A localization clip is identified within the central portion of the mass.  The breast immediately deep to the nipple is tan-white to chalky white soft and friable, grossly appearing to be necrotic.  The remaining uninvolved breast tissue consists of approximately 40% tan-white dense fibrous tissue admixed with 60% tan-yellow, glistening and lobulated unremarkable breast tissue.  Representative sections are submitted.  Summary of sections:  A1 nipple, A2 full thickness section through mass with closest black-inked posterior resection margin, A3 full thickness section through mass with closest blue inked anterior-superior resection margin and closest skin, A4 closest green-inked anterior-inferior margin, A5-A6 remainder of mass, A7 nodular fibrous tissue adjacent to mass, A8 soft and friable tissue deep to nipple, A9 representative upper-outer quadrant, A10 representative lower-outer quadrant, A11 representative upper-inner quadrant, A12 representative lower-inner quadrant.\nJF/cs  **DATE[May 22 12]\n\n<MICROSCOPIC>\nSections examined.

The tumor in the cecum (tumor #1) has a prominent component of tubulovillous adenoma with areas of high grade abnormal cell growth, and only focally invades into the submucosa (multiple H\\T\\E-stained step sections examined).  The second tumor focus (tumor #2) arises from a tubular adenoma in the ascending portion of the colon, and shows more extensive invasion into the muscularis propria.

Submitted fresh and designated \\\"right lung mass\\\" are 2 very hemorrhagic reddish-brown tissue sampling specimens that are submitted for frozen sections and are now entirely submitted in cassette A. B. Submitted fresh and designated \\\"right lung mass for bronchial surgical borders\\\", the specimen consists of a lung lobectomy specimen with staple lines present. The specimen measures up to approximately 12 x 8 x 4 cm in greatest dimensions. The staple line is partially interrupted revealing bronchial surgical borders. The bronchial surgical borders are submitted for frozen sections and are now submitted in cassette B1. The additional lung tissue is then perfused prior to examination. Additional stapled tissue is removed prior to further examination. The pleural surface shows a roughly sutured area measuring 2.5 cm in greatest dimension which probably represents the prior tissue sampling site. Possible anthracotic peribronchial lymph node structures are identified and submitted in cassette B2. Also submitted in cassette B2 are probable vascular surgical borders of excision. The specimen is sectioned with possible pulmonary swelling from fluid accumulation identified; 1.5 cm from the margin of excision (the pleural surface) is a 2.3 cm in greatest dimension hemorrhagic and necrotic appearing mass lesion. This area is sectioned and submitted in cassettes B3 through B6, with pleural surface also submitted.  Sections away from tumor, of possible emphysematous and swelling from fluid accumulationtous tissue, are submitted in cassette B7. C. Submitted fresh and designated \\\"station 4R lymph nodes\\\", the specimen consists of hemorrhagic and anthracotic red-brown soft tissue, with the smaller portion entirely submitted in cassette C1. The larger specimen measures up to 4 x 1.5 x 0.8 cm in greatest dimension. This is sectioned longitudinally and entirely submitted in cassettes C2 and C3. D: **DATE[May 28 2012] - 1637 hours T: **DATE[May 29 2012] - 0746 hours\nMICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION A. The sections are of lung and show a moderately differentiated glandular cancer, with hyperchromatic nuclei, scant eosinophilic to amphophilic cytoplasm and focal mucoid production. B. The sections from the bronchial margin show bronchial tissue with the lung tissue surrounding the bronchus showing a moderate level of emphysematous change. No malignant tumor is seen. The sections from lymph nodes show anthracotic node and the blood vessel shows blood vessel with no tumor present. The multiple sections from the small lump show glandular cancer, moderately differentiated, with focal lepidic spread through the lung parenchyma. Fresh bleeding and emphysematous change are identified in the surrounding soft tissue. The pleural surfaces are uninvolved by tumor. Emphysematous changes are noted throughout the extra sections examined. C. The section show non-cancerous adipose tissue and fibrous tissue with non-cancerous reactive anthracotic lymph node identified. No evidence of metastatic malignant tumor is seen.

Touch preps are made to yield the following diagnosis per the pathologist Dr. **NAME[ZZZ]:  'Evaluation episode #1 (TP #1 and 2):  Non-small cell malignant epithelial tumor.'  The tissue is wrapped and submitted for permanent in A1.\nRA/cs  **DATE[Jun 17 12]\n\n<MICROSCOPIC>\nThe H&E-stained sections of the lung mass tissue sampling show scattered nests of malignant cells on a background of scarring process with focal tissue death.  The malignant cells show areas of gland formation and are characterized by large pleomorphic cells with a high nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio, hyperchromatic nuclei and moderate to abundant amounts of eosinophilic cytoplasm with occasional intracytoplasmic vacuoles.  A panel of immunohistochemical stains is performed on the core biopsies on block A1 and show:\n  CK-5/6    Few scattered cells positive\n  CK-7      Positive\n  CK-20      Negative\n  Napsin-A    Positive\n  P63      Scattered cells positive\n  TTF-1      Positive\n  WT-1      Negative\nInterpretation:  The immunohistochemical stains show the malignant cells are positive for CK-7, Napsin-A, and TTF-1 with weak and focal expression of CK-5/6 and p63.  CK-20 and WT-1 are negative.  The morphologic and immunophenotypic findings are consistent with an glandular cancer of pulmonary origin.\n**INITIALS  **DATE[Jun 19 12]\n\n<INTRAOPERATIVE CONSULT>\n\n<FINAL DX>\nLUNG MASS, CT-GUIDED TISSUE SAMPLING:\n  NON-SMALL CELL MALIGNANT EPITHELIAL TUMOR, CONSISTENT WITH GLANDULAR CANCER OF \n    PULMONARY ORIGIN.\n\n<DX COMMENT>\nEGFR studies are pending and results will be reported in an addendum.

KCA:jlj Dct:Trs:  **DATE[Dec 13 2011] **NAME[ZZZ YYY:  XXX M WWW] MD Pathologist Electronically Signed **DATE[Dec 14 2011]\nPre-Operative Diagnosis: Rectal Cancer Post-Operative Diagnosis: None Given Final Diagnosis: Colon and rectum, segmental resection:   -  Residual glandular cancer with therapy effect, present in submucosa.   -  Metastatic glandular cancer, one of eighteen regional lymph nodes (1/18).   -  Margins of resection free of tumor.   -  Tubular adenoma (0.7 cm).   -  See description and template.\nGross Description: One container is labeled \"colon and rectum\".  The specimen is received in fixative and consists of an unopened 27 cm segment of bowel with a moderate amount of attached pericolonic fat.  A surgical glove is attached to the proximal aspect of the specimen.  The serosa is pink and has dense adhesions.  The proximal margin is closed with a staple line and measures 4.7 cm in circumference.  The distal margin surrounded with anal mucosa is sutured shut and measures 8 cm in circumference.  A 0.5 x 0.3 cm ill-defined slightly invaginated area is located 4.5 cm from the distal surgical margin and 1.2 cm from the dentate line.  The tissue subjacent to this area is cauterized.  The invaginated area does not appear to extend into the bowel wall.  The radial margin is located approximately 0.3 cm from the bowel.  Dilated blood-filled submucosal vessels are present between the dentate line and the distal surgical margin.  A 0.7 x 0.4 x 0.3 cm red growth protruding from a mucous membraneoid structure is located 8 cm from the proximal surgical margin.  The growth protruding from a mucous membrane moves with ease over the muscularis. Additionally received in the same container is a 2 x 2 x 0.9 cm annular piece of tissue partially covered with mucosa.  There is a small amount of attached fat.  One margin is closed with a staple line.  No discrete mass lesions are present. Additionally received in the same container is a 2.5 x 1.5 cm ellipse of tan skin excised to a depth of 2.5 cm.  The surface of the skin is unremarkable.  Representative sections are submitted as follows: 1 - perpendicular proximal margin; 2 - perpendicular distal margin; 3 and 4 - entire invaginated area; 5 - dilated blood-filled vessels; 6 - growth protruding from a mucous membrane; 7 - annular piece of tissue; 8 - separately received piece of skin and underlying soft tissue; 9 through 11 - multiple lymph nodes. JMM:jck\nMicroscopic Description: Sections show focal residual glandular cancer, present within the submucosal at its deepest point, and demonstrating features consistent with therapy effect.  There is no significant extracellular mucin production.  The focus of residual tumor measures less than 0.6 cm in greatest dimension.

The\nsteroid receptor result is graded \"strongly positive\" if there is moderate\nto intense labeling of >90% of tumor cell nuclei, \"weakly positive\" for\nlabeling of 5-20%, \"minimally positive\" for widely scattered labeling of\n<5%, and otherwise \"positive\".  Her2 is scored for membrane positivity\nusing the 0-3+ system specified by the manufacturer as follows:\n     1+ Specific membrane staining, less than circumferential, seen in >10%\nof tumor cells.\n     2+ Weak to moderate circumferential membrane staining, seen in >10% of\ntumor cells.\n     3+ Strong circumferential membrane staining, seen in >30% of tumor\ncells.\nIn the selection of patients for treatment to boost immunity with humanized anti-her2\nantibody (Herceptin), scores of 0+ and 1+ are generally considered negative\nfor overexpression, 2+ is equivocal, and 3+ is positive.\n\nINTRAOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:\nFSA:  Brain tumor:  metastatic malignant epithelial tumor (XX/**INITIALS)\nGROSS DESCRIPTION:  Number of specimen containers: 1.

There is a mild glandular atypia.  High-grade atypia or malignant tumor is not seen. Part B: Sections of the tissue sampling of rectal growth protruding from a mucous membrane reveal a fragment of acutely inflamed granulation tissue.  The second tissue sampling fragment also displays ulceration, acute inflammation, and granulation tissue proliferation. However, there is a proliferation of atypical squamous epithelial cells with associated parakeratosis. Thee are round edged nests extending from the surface mucosa which appear to be malignant epithelial tumor localized tumor. These squamous cells display a marked epithelial atypia and display a marked increase in mitotic activity with 7 and 8 mitotic figures in a single high-powered field. There is also one focus in which there appears to be submucosal invasion with small irregular nests separate from the overlying malignant surface epithelium.  Lymphatic invasion is not seen. Glandular differentiation is not seen.

B)  Left breast:  Infiltrating duct malignant epithelial tumor, moderately differentiated, 1.0 x 1.0 x 0.4 cm, EBR score 3+3+1=7, without lymphvascular invasion.  Duct malignant epithelial tumor localized tumor component, intermediate grade, cribriform type with central comedotissue death.  Multiple radial scars, papillomatosis, stromal scarring process, and marked sclerosing adenosis with luminal microcalcifications in remainder of breast parenchyma. Benign nipple.  Benign deep soft tissue resection margin.\nGross Description: A)  Received fresh designated \"left sentinel node\" is a 2.5 x 1 x 0.9 cm aggregate of yellow lobulated adipose tissue, within which is a 0.4 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm pink-tan small lump.  The small lump is bisected, touch prepped, and submitted entirely for frozen section in one block.  The specimen is now re-submitted for permanents in cassette A-FSC. B)  Received in formalin designated \"left breast\" is a 588 gm, 20 x 20 x 4 cm total mastectomy specimen.  The specimen is partially surfaced by a 10.5 x 6 cm pink-tan skin ellipse.  There is a central 2.5 cm in diameter areola with a 0.7 x 0.7 x 0.3 cm slightly retracted black inverted nipple.  The epidermal surface is notable for a 0.2 cm prior tissue sampling site at the 9-10 o'clock position, 4 cm from the center of the nipple.  There is no orientation provided, thus the aspect of the specimen with the larger flap of fibro-fatty tissue will be designated superior.  The posterior surface of the specimen is inked blue. Sectioning the specimen reveals a 1 x 1 x 0.4 cm tissue sampling cavity within the upper inner quadrant at the 11:00 o'clock position.  The tissue sampling cavity is packed with white pebble-like tissue sampling seed material.  The tissue sampling cavity is 0.5 cm from the nearest deep margin.  The tissue sampling cavity is surrounded by punctate foci of bleeding and fat tissue death, as well as a very ill-defined area of indurated dense white-tan fibrous breast tissue.  The indurated fibrous tissue surrounding the tissue sampling site measures approximately 2 x 1.5 x 1.5 cm.  There is also a small amount of indurated slightly granular fibrous tissue noted extending superiorly from the tissue sampling site.  There are no distinct well-circumscribed masses seen.  There are no other lesional areas identified.  The remainder of the specimen is notable for a moderate amount of dense white-tan fibrous breast tissue and multiple blue-domed fluid-filled sacic structures.  There are no lymph nodes identified.  Representative sections are submitted and placed in formalin at 1430 hours on **DATE[Jun 29 12]. Summary of sections:  B1 - nipple base and remainder of nipple; B2-B9 - tissue sampling site entirely submitted, lateral to medial to include the deep margin in cassettes B4 and B5; B10\\T\\B11 - representative sections of granular fibrous tissue extending superiorly from tissue sampling site; B12 - random upper outer quadrant; B13 - random lower outer quadrant; B14 - random lower inner quadrant.  JAB:jlj\nMicroscopic Description: A)  The lymph node shows a normal architecture and an intact capsule. There are mild reactive changes but no evidence of primary or metastatic neoplasm. B)  Numerous sections from around the circumference of the tissue sampling site reveal very complicated radial scars with complex papillomatosis.  In the center of this area, there is both an intraductal and infiltrating duct malignant epithelial tumor present.  The intraductal component which makes up approximately 50% of the tumor shows very large duct structures distended by atypical epithelial cells in very complicated cribriform-type patterns with central areas of eosinophilic comedotissue death.  The infiltrating cancer portion of the tumor shows small fairly solid aggregates of epithelial cells with focal lumen formations but without well-formed tubular structures present.  These cells show small to moderate amounts of cytoplasm and contain nuclei which vary markedly from small and pyknotic up to giant vesicular nuclei with variably prominent nucleoli.  Occasional mitoses can be identified averaging 2 per 10 high-power fields.  These microscopic findings would score a 3 for tubule formation, 3 for nuclear pleomorphism, and 1 for mitotic count for a combined EBR score of 7, which is moderately differentiated. No definite lymphvascular invasion can be identified.  The neoplasm shows numerous microcalcifications.  An immunoperoxidase stain for e-cadherin reveals marked cytoplasmic positivity of the infiltrating cancer neoplastic cells indicative of ductal origin.  The uninvolved breast tissue shows a localized area of stromal scarring process in association with focal papillomatosis and fairly extensive sclerosing adenosis with numerous luminal microcalcifications.  The deep soft tissue resection margin is free by approximately 0.6 cm from the deeper most aspect of the tissue sampling site scar.  The nipple is unremarkable.

Pathologic classification of cancer extent:  pT1b pN0(sn) MX Receptor studies: Estrogen Receptor (ER) (semiquantitative) /  Progesterone Receptor (PR) (semiquantitative) ER:  Positive:  99% of cells; staining intensity strong PR:  Positive:  80% of cells; staining intensity moderate to strong Method and Scoring Guide for ER/PR: Performed upon routinely formalin fixed and paraffin embedded tissue. ER clone SP1 PR clone 1E2. Scoring Guide:  A positive result is based specifically upon positive nuclear staining within tumor cells, with an intensity graded from weak-mild to strong as noted above.  If the count is greater than 0% by IHC manual morphometry, of any intensity, the result is considered POSITIVE, with only 0% staining considered NEGATIVE. HER-2/neu Status (semiquantitative):  0; Negative Method and Interpretation Guide for HER-2/neu (C-erB-2): Performed upon routinely formalin fixed and paraffin embedded tissue (subject to false-negative results with improper and/or delayed fixation). Specimen identification: -    CASE #:  5227            BLOCK #:  B4 -    Specimen site and type:  Left mastectomy -    Time to fixation:  45 minutes -    Duration of fixation:  7 hours HER-2/neu clone 4B5. Method used:  VENTANA i VIEW PATHWAYS (FDA approved, controls high protein expression, low level protein expression, negative protein expression, internal). Adequacy of sample for evaluation:  Adequate Result interpretation:  Negative Percentage of infiltrating cancer tumor cells exhibiting complete membrane staining:  0% Uniformity of staining present or absent:  Absent Homogeneous dark circumferential pattern present or absent:  Absent Scoring Guide: Staining Pattern                   Result      0    No membrane staining observed      Negative           (or membrane staining observed           in a count of less than 10% of tumor cells).      1+   Faint/partial membrane staining         Negative           (detected in a count of more than 10% of           tumor cells.  Staining may not           encircle entire cell membrane).      2+   Weak complete membrane staining,        Equivocal           observed in a count of more than 10% of tumor cells (encircling entire cell membrane).      3+   Moderate to strong (intense) complete   Positive           membrane staining observed in a count of more than 10% of tumor cells (encircling           entire cell membrane). NOTE:  The immunohistochemical methods utilized for the evaluation of ER/PR receptor status are considered semiquantitative with results expressed as detailed above.   Despite an FDA approved scoring guide that classifies 2+ immunohistochemistry results as equivocal, the literature suggests that up to 70% of these cases may be actually the fluorescence localized tumor hybridization (FISH) negative.  As such, a reflex to HER-2/neu FISH testing could be considered before administration of Herceptin therapy.  The immunohistochemistry methods utilized for the evaluation of ER/PR receptor and HER-2/neu status are considered semiquantitative, with results expressed as detailed above.  These tests were developed and their performance characteristics determined by the **INSTITUTION Pathology Department.  This laboratory is regulated under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA '88), as qualified to perform high complexity testing. **NAME[YYY XXX:  WWW M VVV] MD Pathologist Electronically Signed **DATE[Jun 31 2012]\nSpecimen Source:   APSURG\\T\\AP SURGICAL SPECIMEN\\S\\\\S\\\\S\\\\S\\\\S\\OTHR\\T\\Miscellaneous   SOURCE OF SPECIMEN: A Left sentinal node SOURCE OF SPECIMEN: B Left breast\n"

On three of the core biopsies, in areas of dense\nscarring process, there are nests of infiltrating cancer ductal breast malignant epithelial tumor. The\npresence of these epithelial cells is confirmed with an immunostain for\npancytokeratin (AE1/AE3). Invasive tumor spans a greatest area of up to\n2.8 mm on a single core. \nSlides from the previous breast cancer are not in our files for a direct\nhistologic comparison but given the location within scar tissues and the\nadjacent fat tissue death this is likely near the site of a previous surgical\nprocedure and could be recurrent tumor. The possibility of a new primary\nmalignant epithelial tumor arising at this site can not be completely excluded. \nIMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY (IHC) REPORT:\nANTIBODIES:RESULTS: \n1.

An **NAME[XXX] score of 3 to 8 is considered positive.\nFormalin-fixed, deparaffinized tissue sections (along with appropriate\npositive controls) are incubated with the following monoclonal and/or\npolyclonal antibodies. Localization is via a biotin-free multimer-based\nimmunoperoxidase technique according to an optimized protocol. The\ncontrols are reviewed for the appropriate positive and negative reactivity\nand found to be satisfactory. Results on the population(s) of interest are\nas indicated above. \n \nThese tests were developed and their performance characteristics were\ndetermined by the Department of Anatomic Pathology at Group Health\nCooperative.  The Laboratory is certified under CLIA-88 and is qualified\nto perform high complexity testing.  These tests have not been cleared or\napproved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

Sampling of the presumed area shows marked lymphocytic lobulitis. Although it is of some interest that the in-situ and the infiltrating cancer malignant epithelial tumor are accompanied by marked lymphocyte infiltration, the lobules in the presumed area of satellite small lump do not exhibit convincing cytomorphologic or histoarchitectural features of malignant epithelial tumor (or atypical ductal excessive cell growth), although some reactive changes are appreciated. \n\nThe larger positive node was extensively sampled to evaluate for extranodal extension. It is extensively replaced by malignant epithelial tumor which for the most part appears surrounded by dense scarring process In one area (A20), this scarring process is much more abundant, appears eccentric, contains a nest of malignant epithelial tumor, as well as possible entrapped adipocytes; these features are interpreted as extranodal extension.\nFINAL DX:\n\nBreast and axillary contents, right, mastectomy with axillary dissection: Infiltrating malignant epithelial tumor with the following features:  Histologic type:   Ductal.\nSize:     4.5 x 3.5 x 3 cm.  Histologic grade:   High, G3 of 3.  Nottingham grade:   9 of 9.   Tubule formation:    Poor (3 of 3).   Nuclear grade:   High (3 of 3).   Mitotic rate:    High (3 of 3).  Lymph-vascular invasion:  Identified, focal. Ductal malignant epithelial tumor localized tumor (DCIS) with the following features:  Histologic type:   Solid.  Nuclear grade:    High.  Necrosis:    Present.  Calcifications:    Rare.  Estimated size/extent of DCIS: Rare ducts with DCIS are seen in association with infiltrating        malignant epithelial tumor.      Separate incidental microscopic focus of DCIS with features      similar to those reported above, identified in upper inner      quadrant at 3 cm medial and superior from main mass.\nExtensive intraductal component: Not identified. Surgical surgical borders:  Infiltrating malignant epithelial tumor:   Widely free (distance greater than 1 cm, all surgical borders).  Ductal malignant epithelial tumor localized tumor:   Widely free (distance greater than 1 cm, all surgical borders). Lymph nodes:    Twenty-five lymph nodes identified.         Two lymph nodes with metastatic malignant epithelial tumor (2/25).         Largest metastatic deposit: 3.5 cm.         Focal features consistent with extranodal extension identified. Pathologic stage:   pT2, pN1a (AJCC 7th edition). Additional findings:      Immunohistochemistry staining for estrogen and progesterone receptor expression and Her-2/neu overexpression have previously been performed (as per report ***PATH-NUMBER[1], slides not concurrently reviewed), with the following results: ER positive, 100% of tumor cell nuclei with strong staining, PR positive, 20-25% of tumor cell nuclei with moderate to strong staining, HER-2/neu equivocal by immunohistochemistry (score of 2+), negative for HER-2/neu gene amplification by FISH.    Nipple and skin with focal changes consistent with involvement by malignant epithelial tumor at the base of the    nipple and at the deepest parts of the dermis of skin.    Two hemangiomas of skin, up to 0.4 cm.    Previous tissue sampling site with associated changes.    Striated muscle with no histologic abnormality is seen in some of the samples from the deep margin.\nMICROSCOPIC:\nUnless 'gross exam' is specified, the final diagnosis for each specimen is based on a microscopic examination of the tissue(s)/cells.GROSS:\nReceived fresh, labeled ''**NAME[BBB, CCC]' and designated ''right breast and axillary contents'', is an 1178-g right breast with the letter R and an arrow pointing toward axilla written on the skin with an attached 9 x 8.5 x 3.5 cm axillary tail. It has dimensions as follows: medial to lateral - 23 cm, superior to inferior - 25 cm superficial to deep - 5.5 cm. There is a 20 x 13.5 cm ellipse of skin with a 1 cm, retracted nipple. There are two, 0.4 cm in diameter, red-brown macules within the 5 and 7 o'clock skin regions, respectively, and coming to within 0.3 cm of the nearest skin margin. The specimen is inked as follows: superior superficial - orange, inferior superficial- blue, deep - black. The breast is sectioned from medial to lateral into 30 slices, numbered respectively (nipple between slices 11-12). There is a 4.5 x 3.5 x 3 cm firm white mass in slices 11-14, 4 cm from the deep margin, 4 cm from the superior superficial margin, 7 cm from the inferior superficial margin, 4 cm from the nearest skin margin, and 0.3 cm from the nipple. The remainder of the specimen consists of 90% yellow lobulated adipose tissue and 10% white fibrous tissue. There are 26 possible lymph nodes and one grossly positive lymph node identified within the axillary tail, up to 3.5 cm in diameter. Representative sections are submitted as follows: A1 - nipple, bisected and subareolar tissue; A2 - slice 10, area immediately medial to mass with separate superficial and deep; A3 - slice 11, mass with attached overlying skin and separate deep; A4 - slice 12, representative section of mass with attached subareolar tissue and skin near nipple and separate deep; A5-A6 - slice 13, mass with separate superficial and deep; A7 - slice 14, mass, with separate superficial and deep; A8 - slice 15, area immediately lateral to mass, with separate superficial and deep; A9 - slice 18, upper outer quadrant, with separate superficial and deep; A10 - slice 22, lower outer quadrant, with separate superficial and deep; A11 - slice 8, lower inner quadrant, with separate superficial and deep; A12 - slice 6, upper inner quadrant, with separate superficial and deep (3 cm medial and superior to mass, 1.5 cm from the deep margin, 2.5 cm from the superior superficial margin, 8 cm from the inferior superficial margin, 2.5 cm from the nearest skin margin, and 3.3 cm from the nipple); A13 - six possible axillary lymph nodes; A14 - six possible axillary lymph nodes; A15 - five possible axillary lymph nodes; A16 - four possible axillary lymph nodes; A17 - two possible axillary lymph nodes; A18 - two possible axillary lymph nodes; A19 - one possible axillary lymph node, serially sectioned; A20 - representative sections of grossly positive lymph node; A21 - slice 5, upper inner quadrant, directly medial to section from cassette A12, with separate superficial and deep; A22 - slice 7, immediately lateral to section from cassette A12, with separate superficial and deep; A23 - slice 16, possible satellite small lump; A24 - slice 17, possible satellite small lump; A25 - slice 15, possible satellite small lump; A26-A27 - representative additional sections of grossly positive lymph node; A28 - representative sections of skin macules. Specimen was put into formalin at approximately 4 p.m. on **DATE[Feb 02 2012] and will have a total time in formalin of 20-1/2 hours.

Clinical history:  History of breast cancer.\nCopy To:   Specimen(s) Received: Right Breast mass\nFinal Diagnosis Biopsy right breast mass;             A.     Metaplastic malignant epithelial tumor, intermediate grade, spindle cell type (1.9 cm greatest diameter measured histologically).       B.     Tumor abuts against inked surgical surgical borders of the tissue sampling specimen.       C.     Central areas of sclerotic scar and entrapped degenerating adipose tissue consistent with remote radiation effect.   Comment:    This case was reviewed at the **INSTITUTION **INSTITUTION Breast Pathology section  by Dr. **NAME[ZZZ M. YYY].  The above diagnosis reflects her consultative opinion.  The complete report from  **INSTITUTION is appended below.                      1  Electronically Signed Out By Ben **NAME[M. XXX], MD Results {Not Entered} Interpretation-Comments {Not Entered}\nGross Description Specimen #1 is received fresh for frozen section, labeled with the patient's name and designated \"right breast tissue sampling.\"  The specimen consists of a fatty tissue fragment measuring 3.5 x 3.3 x 2.0 cm.  The external surface is soft and lobulated.  The external surface is inked black.  The cut surface reveals a well-defined yellow-gray firm mass measuring 2.0 x 1.8 x 1.4 cm.  The mass abuts the resection margin.  The remaining breast tissue is yellow-pink, soft and fatty.  A representative section of the mass is submitted for frozen section.  The frozen section remnant is submitted in (block A).  The remaining mass submitted in (blocks B through D).  A representative section of unremarkable breast tissue is submitted in (block E).  **INITIALS\nMicroscopic Description Sections of right breast tissue sampling reveal a relatively well-delineated nodular lesion demonstrating a central area of sclerosis, scarring and entrapped degenerating adipose tissue.  This area was represented primarily in frozen section samples.  Adjacent to and peripheral to this area are foci of a spindle cell proliferation showing a much higher cellularity.  The spindle cells are arranged in a haphazard fashion with occasional formation of sheets and fascicles.  Nuclei are elongated and demonstrate a slight increase in density of chromatin.  Significant numbers of mitotic figures are observed.  The tumor abuts against the inked surgical margin of excision of the tissue sampling.   This case was sent in consultation to Dr. **NAME[ZZZ YYY] at **NAME[WWW] University **INSTITUTION who feels that this lesion represents a metaplastic malignant epithelial tumor of intermediate grade, spindle cell type.  The malignant cells express p63, and Cytokeratins CK5/6, AE1/AE3 and are CK903 positive, which are findings characteristic of metaplastic malignant epithelial tumors.

B)  Left thyroid lobe, lobectomy:  Multifocal papillary malignant epithelial tumor ( largest focus 1.1 x 0.3 cm), in a background of hyperplastic thyroid, consistent with Grave's disease with patchy lymphocytic thyroiditis.\nGross Description: Two containers. A)  Container A is labeled \\\"right thyroid lobe\\\".  The specimen is received in fixative and consists of a 24 gram, 7 x 4 x 3 cm lobulated lobe of thyroid.  The specimen is inked.  A 1.5 x 1.3 x 1 cm small lump is attached to the edge of the thyroid lobe.  The cut surface is deep red and has a 0.4 x 0.3 x 0.3 cm white small lump.  The remaining cut surface has no discrete mass lesions.  Representative sections are submitted as follows: A1 - entire small lump attached to the thyroid gland; A2 - entire small white small lump; A3 through A8 - representative sections. B)  Specimen B is labeled \\\"left thyroid lobe\\\".  The specimen is received in fixative and consists of a 23 gram, 6.5 x 4 x 3 cm lobulated tan-gray lobe of thyroid.  The specimen is inked.  The cut surface is vaguely nodular and ranges from pink to red.  A single 0.4 cm solid white small lump is present.  No additional mass lesions are identified.  Representative sections are submitted as follows: B1 - entire small lump; B2 through B6 - random sections of thyroid. JMM:jck\nMicroscopic Description: A \\T\\ B)  Right and left lobes, lobectomies:  Sections from both thyroid lobes reveal similar findings demonstrating numerous thyroid follicles of varying sizes and shapes containing varying amounts of colloid. Patchy areas of lymphoid aggregates are noted, consistent with focal lymphocytic thyroiditis.  There are small Hurthle cell small lumps noted also.  Some of the follicles demonstrate pseudopapillary projections within the follicles.  However, additionally, there are several foci of demonstrating nuclear features of papillary thyroid malignant epithelial tumor with enlarged, hypochromatic nuclei with occasional nuclear grooves, nuclear overlapping, and an occasional intranuclear inclusion.  Two non-cancerous lymph nodes are noted.  For further details, see case summary below.

Breast, Right Breast Biopsy at 12 O'Clock, Core Biopsy:\nInvasive Ductal Adenomalignant epithelial tumor, Nuclear Grade 3, Histologic Grade 3 (Poorly Differentiated). \nTumor is Present in Three of Three (3 of 3) Tissue Cores, the Largest Fragment Measuring Approximately 1.8cm; Clinical Correlation Recommended. \n\n2.  Lymph Node, Right Axillary Lymph Node, Biopsy:\nInvasive Ductal Adenomalignant epithelial tumor, Identical to That Seen in Part #1, Present in One (1) Core (No Lymph Node Tissue).\nTwo (2) Other Core Biopsy Fragments of Lymph Node Without Evidence of Metastatic Carcinoma; Clinical Correlation Recommended. \n\nCOMMENT: \n  This case is reviewed at the Daily Departmental Conference. Receptor studies pending and results will follow as an addendum.\nGrossDescription:\n  Container 1:  Received in formalin labeled right breast tissue sampling 12 o?clock per the container and right breast tissue sampling 12 o?clock 2.0cm from nipple per the requisition are three cylindrical portions of tan to pink, soft tissue ranging from 0.4 x 0.1cm to 1.8 x 0.2cm.  The specimen is submitted in toto as 1A.\n\n  Container 2:  Received in formalin labeled right axilla lymph node are three cylindrical portions of tan to pink, soft tissue ranging from 0.8 x 0.2cm to 1.5 x 0.2cm.  The specimen is submitted in toto as 2A.\n\n  Fixation of specimen reviewed and assured to be 6 to 48 hours. \nAC:lefb **DATE[Mar 4 2013].\nMicroscopicDescription:\n  Slides reviewed.\n1: Right breast core tissue sampling2: Right lymph node core tissue sampling\nAddendumComment:\nER/PR HERCEPTEST (QUANTITATIVE INTERPRETATION)\nEstrogen and Progesterone Receptor analysis and the Herceptest (DAKO) for HER2 protein overexpression are performed on formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissue (Block 1A) using immunohistochemical techniques.\n\nIMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY TECHNICAL INFORMATION: \nDeparaffinized sections of tissue are incubated with the following panel of monoclonal antibodies, along with appropriate positive controls.  Localization is via a biotin free, EnVision Flex + immunoperoxidase system with pretreatment (heat induced epitope retrieval) according to laboratory optimization for each antibody.  The control slides for each test are reviewed for appropriate positive and negative reactivity and found to be satisfactory.\n\nSUMMATION OF FINDINGS: \nThe Estrogen Receptor (VECTOR CLONE 6F11) is negative in >99% of the tumor cells.  The Progesterone Receptor (DAKO Clone PgR 636) is negative in 100% of the tumor cells.  The Herceptest (DAKO) shows 2+ indeterminate staining, after evaluation of membrane staining intensity and pattern on the standardized  0 to 3+ scale.  FISH for Her2neu will be performed.\n\nNOTE:   Positive Estrogen Receptor is defined as positive staining of greater than or equal to 1% of tumor cells.  Positive Progesterone receptor is defined as positive staining of greater than or equal to 1% of tumor cells.\n\nImmunohistochemical estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor test results are reported using the ASCO CAP scoring criteria.  If positive, staining intensity may be reported numerically 1, 2, 3+ or descriptively as weak, moderate or strong. \n\nNOTE:   ASCO/CAP scoring criteria for HER2 protein over expression by immunohistochemistry are as stated: Positive cases show strong and complete membrane staining in greater than 30% of infiltrating cancer cancer cells (score 3).  Negative cases are defined as those with no staining (score 0) or weak, incomplete membrane staining in any proportion of cells (score 1).  Equivocal or indeterminate cases show strong staining in less than or equal to 30% of cells or less than strong but complete staining in any proportion of cells.  \n\nPQRS CODE: 3394F\n\n"

Appropriately controlled immunohistochemical stains performed\nat XXXXX show the tumor cells to be positive for\nCK7 (focal). P63 and CK5/6 show strong and diffuse staining, supporting\nsquamous differentiation.  The tumor cells are negative for TTF-1 and CD56.\nAdditional immunohistochemical stains show associated lymphocytes are\npositive for CD5 and CD99, and scattered lymphocytes are positive for TdT\nand CD1a.  The findings are certainly histologically compatible with a\nprimary lung squamous cell malignant epithelial tumor. However, given the suggestion of an\nanterior mediastinal mass and the unusual clinical course per the patient's\nelectronic medical record, a bland, low grade thymic tumor with squamous\nfeatures is certainly possible. Correlation with clinical and radiologic\nfindings is needed.\n\ndiagnosis: lymphoma, teratoma, thymoma, thyroid malignant epithelial tumor, lung malignant epithelial tumor.\nMICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION: Histologic examination performed.\n\nThe staff pathologist was present during the formal review and\ninterpretation of all slides and ancillary studies, (if performed), with\nthe medical student or resident.\n\n\n\n\n**NAME[ZZZ YYY], MD\nPathologist\nElectronically signed **DATE[Apr 24 2012] 06:56 PM\nMATERIALS SUBMITTED:\nStained slides:  Received 22 slides 10 labeled (***path number ***  and 12\nlabeled (***path number *** from **STREET-ADDRESS **PLACE, NM **ZIP-CODE.\nUnstained slides:  None\nParaffin blocks:  None\nOther:  Pathology Report numbering 1 corresponding to the slides received.\n"

Received in formalin designated \\\"solitary pulmonary small lump right upper lung lobe\\\" is a wedge tissue sampling of tan-pink to dark red pulmonary parenchyma which weighs 24 grams and measures 6 x 5 x 3 cm.  There is a palpable small lump within the specimen.  The overlying pleura is puckered.  This region is inked with black ink.  The staple lines are removed, and the   PATHOLOGY REPORT   \\T\\a9.3L   GROSS DESCRIPTION          (Continued)   underlying parenchyma is dark red to light tan with black reticulations.  No tumor is visible at the parenchymal margin.  The parenchymal surgical borders are submitted in blocks A1-A2. The specimen is sectioned showing a tan-white tumor with foci of black discoloration.  It measures 2.2 x 2 x 1.8 cm.  The tumor approaches the pleural surface within less than 0.1 cm.  Sections of the tumor are submitted in A3-A5.  The remainder of the parenchyma is spongy dark red with black reticulations.  Representative sections are submitted in block A6.   B.  Received in formalin designated \\\"inferior pulmonary ligament lymph node\\\" is a gray-black lymph node with a small amount of attached adipose tissue measuring 0.5 x 0.4 x 0.2 cm.  It is entirely submitted in B.   C.  Received in formalin designated \\\"level 4R lymph node\\\" are multiple fragments of gray-black lymph node with a small amount of attached adipose tissue measuring 2 x 1.5 x 0.4 cm. in aggregate.  The specimen is entirely submitted in block C.   D.  Received in formalin designated \\\"level 7 lymph node\\\" is a gray-black lymph node which measures 2 x 1 x 0.5 cm.  The specimen is sectioned and has a homogeneous jet-black cut surface.  It is entirely submitted in block D. \nMICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION   A.  Sections of the tumor show an infiltrating cancer non-small cell malignant epithelial tumor.  Centrally, there is a scar.  The tumor shows glandular differentiation throughout much of its volume with areas of bronchoalveolar malignant epithelial tumor-like growth at its periphery.  Centrally, there is a desmoplasatic response.  There are also areas in which the tumor infiltrates in solid nests and in fused glandular arrays.  Tumor cells have large nuclei with prominent nucleoli.  PAS stains with and without diastase confirm mucin production in tumor cells.  At the pleural surface, there is mild scarring process and chronic inflammation with retraction of the pleura, but invasion of the pleura is not seen on elastin stains (x3, blocks A3-A5).  Immunohistochemical stains are completed with adequate positive and negative controls in an attempt to further define tumor origin.  Tumor cells show diffuse strong staining for cytokeratin 7.  They are negative for cytokeratin 20.  A TTF-1 stain shows diffuse moderate to strong nuclear staining of tumor cells.  Tumor cells are also positive for estrogen receptor.   B-D.

The specimen consists of six yellow-pink to gray soft tissue core biopsies measuring up to 4 cm in length x 0.4 cm in diameter. The cores appear predominantly fatty with focal areas of pink-gray fibrous tissue measuring up to 0.6 cm in dimension.  A radiograph does not accompany the specimen.  The cores are totally submitted in (blocks A-C). **INITIALS\nMicroscopic Description Sections of needle core biopsies of left breast mass reveal at least partial involvement of all tissue sampling cylinders by an infiltrating ductal malignant epithelial tumor (grade 2).  The tumor demonstrates no significant tubule formation and malignant ductal epithelial cells are arranged in rounded nests, narrow ribbons, and irregular clusters.  There is subtle infiltration of adjacent adipose tissue with most areas of tumor demonstrating a dense sclerotic and focally elastotic fibrous stroma.  Tumor nuclei are moderately enlarged with distinct round nucleoli and some show vesiculation of nuclear chromatin.  Tumor demonstrates a low mitotic index with an average of two mitoses observed per 10 high power fields.  There is no distinct angiolymphatic invasion by tumor identified.  Maximum linear diameter of any focus of tumor is 1.4 cm.

CPT4 88305 / ICD9 153.4 / MC: M82103 OUTSIDE CONSULTATION (Reviewed by Dr. **NAME[ZZZ YYY] at P\\T\\C Laboratories)  See separate outside report. CONSULTANT's DIAGNOSIS: COLON GROWTH PROTRUDING FROM A MUCOUS MEMBRANE AT THE ILEOCECAL VALVE:  Superficial fragments of at least intramucosal glandular cancer, see microscopic description and comment on outside report. (The consultant recommended complete excision of this lesion to exclude the possibility of a frankly infiltrating cancer neoplasm.)\nGROSS DESCRIPTION The specimen is labeled \"ileocecal valve biospy\" and consists of three fragments of tan mucosa measuring 0.3 cm each. The specimen is entirely submitted in cassette 1.\nMICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION Sections show colonic mucosa with growth protruding from a mucous membraneoid formation present.  Tubular adenoma with medium-grade abnormal cell growth is present.  Deeper sections show tubular adenoma with focal high-grade abnormal cell growth. Deeper sections show glandular cancer with infiltrating cancer features noted. <Sign Out Dr. **NAME[XXX]> **NAME[WWW VVV], M.D, PATHOLOGIST Page 1 of 1\nTISSUE SUBMITTED:  COLON TISSUE SAMPLING, SURGICAL TISSUE SAMPLING Ileocecal valve tissue sampling\n"

The findings were discussed with Dr. **NAME[ZZZ] on **DATE[Feb 7 2012]. |\nGrossDescription:\nReceived fresh labeled \"left breast mass\" is an oriented breast mass excision specimen measuring 8 x 5 x 2 cm.  The specimen is demarcated with margin markers and inked as follows:  medial - red, caudal - green, cranial - blue, skin - orange, lateral - violet, and deep - black.  Sections reveal a centralized hemorrhagic cavity filled with approximately 10 - 20 ccs of blood.  The lining of the cavity is tan-yellow, pink and smooth with no excrescences.  The outlying tissue is predominantly tan-yellow, fibro-fatty breast parenchyma with no circumscribed lesions or masses noted grossly.  The cavity wall is within 0.3 cm of the nearest cranial margin and more than 0.5 cm from all other surgical borders.  The cavity appears to have no definite involvement of the resection margin.  Representative sections are submitted from medial to lateral in sixteen cassettes with the medial most aspect in cassette 1, lateral most aspect in cassette 12, and mostly representative sections of hemorrhagic fluid-filled sac in cassettes 2 - 15.  The specimen was collected on **DATE[Feb 5 12] at 10:23 a.m. and placed in formalin at 11:00 a.m. for a fixation time of 7 hours.\nMicroscopicDescription:\nConfirmed.\nA: Left breast mass\nAddendumDiagnosis:\nPROGNOSTIC PANEL SUMMARY\n\n\nEstrogen receptor (clone 1D5):    Negative\nProgesterone receptor (clone PgR 636):  Negative\nHER-2/neu (HercepTest):      Negative for overexpression\nKi-67 (clone Ki-S5):      Elevated cell proliferation\np53 (clone DO7):        Normal\n\nFormalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections, see image analysis report for complete analytic results.\nAddendumComment:\nImmunohistochemical stains p63, myosin heavy chain and E-cadherin are performed and support the diagnosis.\n"

Given the rarity of this diagnosis, the case has been forwarded to Dr. **NAME[ZZZ YYY], Professor and **NAME[CCC] of **NAME[DDD] at Oregon Health and **INSTITUTION, for her expert opinion.  Once received, her consultative report will be issued as an addendum to this report\n\nCase reviewed in Pathology Staff Conference on **DATE[Feb 16 12] and **DATE[Feb 21 12].  The findings were discussed with **NAME[XXX WWW], PA-C on **DATE[Feb 21 12] at 3:41 a.m./r/n\nGrossDescription:\nLabeled:      Patient name and medical record number, designated right anterior thigh\nSpecimen:    0.5 x 0.5 cm excised to a depth of 0.4 cm punch tissue sampling (formalin)\nLesion:      Ill-defined 0.3 x 0.2 x 0.1 cm pale gray focus present at the margin\nSubmitted/Block:    Entirely bisected/1./r/n\nMicroscopicDescription:\nThe H\\T\\E-stained sections demonstrate an atypical dermal infiltrate comprised of widely scattered large atypical lymphoid cells admixed with small, mature lymphocytes, scattered histiocytes, and rare eosinophils. The atypical cells have abundant cytoplasm and nuclei with irregular contours, pale chromatin, and prominent eosinophilic nucleoli.  \n\nTo further investigate, immunohistochemical stains are performed on sections from block A1 with appropriately staining positive and negative controls.  The large atypical lymphoid cells are positive for CD30 (membranous and Golgi-staining patterns), CD15 (membranous and Golgi-staining patterns), PAX-5 (dim), and CD20 (membranous).  They are negative for BCL6, BCL2, CD10, CD45, EMA, CD3, and CD5.  No significant staining with CD21 is identified.  The interspersed small lymphocytes are a mixture of CD20-positive B-cells and CD3-positive T-cells (with a subset co-expressing CD5)./r/n\nA: Right anterior thigh, punch tissue sampling\nAddendumDiagnosis:\nSkin, right anterior thigh, punch tissue sampling (**PLACE, HI, ***PATH-NUMBER[1], **DATE[Feb 14 2012]):\n        Atypical lymphoid proliferation (see Note)./r/nAddendumComment:\nThe following results were performed at **INSTITUTION Department of Pathology and reported by \n**NAME[ZZZ YYY], M.D. on **DATE[Mar 13 2012].  The results were discussed with **NAME[EEE WWW] on **DATE[Mar 19 12] at 10:15 a.m.\n\n\nNote:  We agree that the histologic appearance of the dermal infiltrate is highly suggestive of cutaneous involvement by classical Hodgkin lymphoma (CHL).  However, there are a number of features that prevent us from making a definitive diagnosis.  Both the site and the clinical history are extremely unusual for CHL, but the major impediment to establishing a definitive diagnosis is that the immunophenotype is also not completely characteristic.  All of the large cells show strong CD20 and PAX5-positivity, as well as some CD45 positivity.  CD30 staining is positive but somewhat weak for CHL, and CD15 is almost completely negative.\n\nThis is an extremely challenging case.  Since there are multiple infectious/inflammatory processes that can mimic many features of CHL, in the absence of a classic immunophenotype and in conjunction with the unusual site and clinical presentation, we are unable to make a definitive diagnosis of CHL.  There are numerous small background T-cells, as well as numerous variably-sized B-cells, but, in our opinion, the atypical lymphoid infiltrate does not meet the criteria for peripheral T-cell lymphoma or B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma either.  Antigen receptor PCR analyses for B-cell and T-cell clonality were performed in consideration of non-Hodgkin lymphoma and both were negative.  The case was reviewed at the **NAME[DDD FFF] Conference on **DATE[Mar 5 2012] by Drs. **NAME[VVV, UUU, TTT] and **NAME[SSS]: they concur with this interpretation.\n\nMicroscopic Description:  Hematoxylin and eosin stained sections of the skin punch tissue sampling show skin with a superficial to deep dense lymphocyte infiltration restricted to the dermis and not involving the overlying epidermis.  Scattered large atypical cells with prominent nucleoli and cytoplasmic clearing/retraction resembling classical Hodgkin lymphoma lacunar cells are present.  The background infiltrate is composed of numerous small lymphocytes, histiocytes, and occasional plasma cells.\n\nImmunohistochemical Stains:  The following immunostains were received for review from the referring institution:  CD3, CD5, CD10, CD15, CD20, CD21, CD30, CD45, BCL2, BCL6, PAX 5 and EMA.  Limited additional immunostaining were performed at OHSU, using the CD3, CD15, CD20, CD30 and PAX 5 antibodies, which showed similar staining to the outside immunostains.  The large atypical cells show the following immunophenotype:\n  CD3  negative\n  CD5  negative\n  CD10  negative\n  CD15  rare positive cells\n  CD20  strongly and homogenously positive\n  CD30  variably positive\n  CD45  variably positive\n  BCL2  negative\n  BCL6  occasional positive cell\n  PAX 5  strongly positive\n\nThe background small lymphocytes are mainly CD3 and CD5-positive T-cells, but there are also numerous, variably-sized B-cells in the infiltrate, highlighted by staining with the CD20 and PAX 5 antibodies.\n\nIn Situ Hybridization:  Molecular probes were used in an localized tumor hybridization analysis for **NAME[RRR QQQ] virus encoded mRNA.  Appropriate controls, including RNA controls, were performed and test validity confirmed.  The large atypical cells are negative for Epstein-Barr virus on the localized tumor hybridization analysis.\n\n(Analyte specific reagents are used in many laboratory tests necessary for standard medical care and generally do not require FDA approval.  This test was developed and its performance characteristics determined by OHSU laboratories.  It has not been cleared or approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration)./r/n\n"

Pathway Anti-HER2 rabbit monoclonal\nantibody, clone 4B5) are carried out on formalin-fixed,\nparaffin-embedded tissue sections.  Positive and negative controls show\nappropriate reactivity. Interpretation of Ventana Pathway for HER2\nimmunostain is performed according to guidelines recommended by ASCO/CAP\nin 2007 (see comment below).  Results are as follows:\nBlock A1\n\nAntibody  Result    Comment\nHER2 1+   Negative for overexpression\n\nImpression:\nInterpreted by:  **NAME[VVV M. UUU] MD\nComment:\n\n1.  The guideline recommendations by ASCO/CAP in 2007 is as follows:  A\nscore of 3+ (positive HER2 test) is defined by uniform intense membrane\nstaining in >30% of tumor cells.  A score of 2+ (equivocal HER2 test) is\ndefined by complete membrane staining that is either nonuniform or weak\nin intensity but with obvious circumferential distribution in at least\n10% of tumor cells, or less commonly, intense complete membrane staining\nbut in only 30% or fewer tumor cells.  A score of 0 or 1+ (negative HER2\ntest) is defined by no or weak and incomplete membrane staining in any\nproportion of tumor cells.\n2.  The correlation between HER2 protein overexpression by\nimmunohistochemistry and HER2/neu gene amplification by fluorescence in\nsitu hybridization (FISH) is not 100%.  Rare cases interpreted as\nnegative (0 and 1+) for HER2 protein overexpression may demonstrate low\nlevel HER2/neu gene amplification by FISH.  Approximately 10-20% of\ncases interpreted as 2+ may show gene amplification by FISH, while the\nvast majority of cases, if not all, interpreted as 3+ show gene\namplification by FISH.  Therefore, additional testing for HER2/neu gene\namplification by fluorescence localized tumor hybridization (FISH) may be\nconsidered on individual cases, if clinically warranted.  Reflexive\ntesting for HER2/neu gene amplification by FISH will be performed on all\ncases interpreted as 2+ (equivocal for protein overexpression) by\nimmunohistochemistry.

These blasts are predominantly small to occasional medium sized cells with scant cytoplasm, irregular shaped nuclear contour and rare inconspicuous nucleoli.  The erythrocytes are normochromic.  Nucleated RBC s are not noted.  The platelets are normal in quantity.  \n\nBONE TISSUE SAMPLING SECTION:  The bone tissue sampling is hypercellular.  The cellularity is approximately 80%.  Sheets of blasts are present and comprise approximately 80% of the nucleated cell population.  Immunoperoxidase stains show that these blasts express BCL-2, CD5, CD3 and TdT, similar immunophenotype as the T lymphoblasts previously seen in this patient s prior bone marrow tissue sampling.  The scant red-cell series is normoblastic.  The myeloid to erythroid ratio is approximately 3:1.  The scant myeloid cell lines show normal maturation.  There are adequate numbers of megakaryocytes.  No small area of inflammationta, extrinsic cells, vascular lesions or parasites are seen.\n\nASPIRATION SMEARS:  The smears confirm the findings noted above.  Lymphoblasts comprise approximately 80% of the nucleated cell population.  The blasts are predominantly small to occasional medium sized cells with scant cytoplasm, irregular shaped nuclear contour and rare inconspicuous nucleoli.  The scant numbers of myeloid and erythroid precursors show no evidence of maturation arrest.

COMMENT: The sizes of these two infiltrating cancer tumors identified in the left breast are difficult to determine with absolute certainty due to disruption from the prior biopsies:  Final classification of cancer extent must be performed by the oncologist/surgeon in correlation with all pathologic, imaging, surgical and clinical information.  See microscopic section below for summary of CAP Tumor Reporting protocol. **INITIALS  Electronically Signed Out By **NAME[ZZZ], M.D., **NAME[YYY]\nGross Description 1:  Received fresh designated 'left sentinel lymph node' is fat containing two small lumps consistent with lymph nodes measuring 2.5 x 2.0 x 1.2 cm and 2.6 x 2.0 x 1.2 cm.  Each small lump is sectioned through the short axis and frozen in separate blocks with controls submitted as FSC1A and FSC1B.  CLS/in 2:  Received fresh designated \"left sentinel node\" is fat containing two separate small lumps consistent with lymph nodes, measuring 1.0 x 1.0 x 0.6 cm, and 3.0 x 2.5 x 1.4 cm.  The smaller small lump is sectioned and entirely frozen in one block with control submitted as FSC2A.  The remaining small lump is sectioned and frozen in two blocks with controls submitted as FSC2B, and 2C.   **INITIALS 3:  Received in formalin labeled 'left breast is a 755 gram unoriented left simple mastectomy specimen having a small amount of contiguous axillary fat.  The axillary fat is utilized to orient the specimen.  The specimen is 21.1 cm from medial to lateral, 18.4 cm from superior to inferior and 5.4 cm from anterior to posterior.  The anterior surface is partially covered by 22.1 x 9.3 cm ellipse of white tan skin which includes a 3.9 cm pale areola and a 1.0 x 1.0 x 0.5 cm nipple.  The nipple and areola are partially discolored by a blue dye.  8.8 cm lateral and slightly superior to the nipple there is a 0.3 x 0.3 x 0.3 cm purple red skin lesion.  3.3 cm superior to the nipple in the midline there is a 0.2 cm hyperemic area which may be a site of previous mammotome tissue sampling entry.  The skin is otherwise unremarkable.  The superior inferior soft tissue surgical borders are composed of lobulated fatty tissue.  The deep margin is partially covered by fascia and shows no apparent skeletal muscle.  The superior soft tissue margin is inked blue the inferior soft tissue margin is inked yellow and the deep soft tissue margin is inked black.  The specimen is serially sectioned.  Two separate areas of previous tissue sampling are identified.  Within the medial inferior aspect of the upper inner quadrant there is a 1.0 cm in greatest dimension surgigel filled tissue sampling site having a metal clip within.  The adjacent tissue is mildly indurated but there is no grossly apparent residual tumor.  This tissue sampling site is 2.5 cm from the deep margin which is the closest margin.  Within the inferior medial aspect of the lower inner quadrant there is a 1.0 cm in greatest dimension surgigel filled tissue sampling site having an adjacent 1.0 x 0.8 x 0.7 cm area of induration.  This tissue sampling site is 1.5 cm from the inferior soft tissue margin which is the closest margin.  Although the tissue adjacent to the tissue sampling site is indurated there is no grossly apparent residual tumor.  The remainder of the breast is composed primarily of fat with focal strands of white fibrous-like.  Thorough examination of the tissues at what appears to be the upper outer quadrant reveals a solitary 1 cm lymph node candidate.  This is the only apparent lymph node with the specimen.  Detached but within the same container are four pieces of skin and unremarkable fatty tissue ranging from 6.1  11.7 cm in greatest dimension.  These weigh an additional 41 grams.  Sections are submitted as follows: 3A  nipple and areola 3B  skin lesion 3C  punctate area superior to nipple 3D through 3G  upper inner quadrant tissue sampling site with metal marker removed from block 3D 3H  deep margin closest to upper inner quadrant tissue sampling site 3I, J  tissue between upper inner quadrant and lower inner quadrant tissue sampling sites 3K through 3P  lower inner quadrant tissue sampling site and adjacent indurated tissue 3Q  inferior soft tissue margin closest to lower inner quadrant tissue sampling site 3R  representative section upper inner quadrant 2 cm from upper inner quadrant tissue sampling site 3S  representative section lower inner quadrant 1 cm medial to lower inner quadrant tissue sampling site 3T  representative section upper outer quadrant 3U  representative section lower outer quadrant 3V  serially sectioned axillary lymph node candidate The specimen was removed from the patient at 10:45 hr **DATE[Mar 9 12] and initially placed into formalin at 10:46 hrs 9/9 11.  The specimen is described sectioned and resubmitted into formalin at 12:59 hr **DATE[Mar 9 12]. LW/USO/CLS/in  4:  Received in formalin labeled \"right breast\" is a 21.1 x 18.3 x 5.3 cm, 736-gram unoriented simple mastectomy specimen.  The anterior surface is partially covered by a 21 x 11.5 cm ellipse of white tan skin which includes a 4.0 cm in greatest dimension pale areola with a central 1.0 x 1.0 x 0.7 cm nipple.  The skin shows a few purple red to waxy tan skin lesions ranging from 0.2 to 0.8 cm in greatest dimension.  Several of the skin lesions come to within 0.4 cm of the skin surgical borders. The exposed superficial soft tissue surgical borders are composed of lobulated fatty tissue.  The deep margin is covered by fascia and shows a few thin and delicate strands of skeletal muscle.  The superficial surgical borders are inked blue and the deep margin is inked black.  The specimen is then serially sectioned.  This shows predominantly fat with areas of white mammary tissue scattered within, primarily in the central portion of the breast.  No lesions are seen.  No lymph nodes are included with the specimen.  Sections are submitted as follows: 4A:  Nipple and areola. 4B, 4C:  Representative skin lesions and relationship to closest skin margin. 4D through 4K:  Two random sections from each quadrant. 4L:  Random section, central deep margin. The specimen was removed from the patient at 10:33 hours, **DATE[Mar 9 12], and initially placed into formalin at 10:34 hours, **DATE[Mar 9 12].  The specimen is described, sectioned and resubmitted into formalin at 14:02 hours, **DATE[Mar 9 12].   **INITIALS On **DATE[Mar 10 12], additional random sections of breast parenchyma are submitted in six blocks. **INITIALS\nMicroscopic Description Incorporated in diagnosis.

Macroscopic and Microscopic Extent of Tumor:       Skin:  Carcinoma does not invade into the dermis or epidermis of skin.      Nipple: DCIS does not involve the nipple.                Skeletal Muscle: No skeletal muscle is present. Tumor Histologic Type / Upper Inner Quadrant: Invasive ductal malignant epithelial tumor. Histologic Grade: Well differentiated/Grade I out of III (Nottingham score - tubule formation 2/3, nuclear pleomorphism 2/3,          mitotic activity 1/3; total score 5/9). Ductal Carcinoma In Situ: Intermediate nuclear grade ductal malignant epithelial tumor localized tumor without central tissue death, solid and cribriform       patterns, extends beyond the infiltrating cancer component to involve the upper and lower inner quadrants. Size of Invasive Tumor: 0.5 cm (see Comment). Tumor Histologic Type / Lower Inner Quadrant: Invasive ductal malignant epithelial tumor. Histologic Grade: Moderately differentiated/Grade II out of III (Nottingham score - tubule formation 3/3, nuclear pleomorphism 2/3,          mitotic activity 1/3; total score 6/9). Size of Invasive Tumor: 0.3 cm (see Comment). Lymph/Vascular Space Invasion: Not identified. Margin Status: Margins are widely negative for malignant tumor (closest deep and superficial inferior surgical borders measure 2.5 and 1.5 cm      respectively). Number of Sentinel Lymph Nodes Examined: 4.  Number of Non-sentinel Lymph Nodes Examined: 1.  Number of Sentinel Lymph Nodes with Microspread of cancer: 1. Number of Sentinel Lymph Nodes with Macrospread of cancer: 0. Size of Largest Metastatic Deposit (0.1 cm). Extranodal Extension: Not identified. Estrogen and Progesterone Receptors, and Her/2-neu: See prior tissue sampling results (***PATH-NUMBER[1], ***PATH-NUMBER[2]). AJCC Pathologic Tumor Stage: T1a N1mi Mx Specimen: Right breast. Procedure: Simple mastectomy. Lymph Node Sampling: No lymph nodes sampled. Specimen Integrity: Intact mastectomy. Tumor Site: Indeterminant. Tumor Size: Single microscopic focus identified in random section- 0.3 cm in diameter. Histologic Type: Intermediate nuclear grade ductal malignant epithelial tumor localized tumor without central tissue death, solid pattern; negative for infiltrating cancer malignant tumor. Margins: Margins are uninvolved by DCIS. Estrogen and Progesterone Receptors: Available upon request. AJCC Pathologic Tumor Stage: Tis (DCIS). Comment: The sizes of these infiltrating cancer tumors identified in the left breast are difficult to determine with absolute certainty due to disrupt ion from the prior biopsies. Final classification of cancer extent must be performed by the oncologist/surgeon in correlation with all pathologic, imaging, surgical and clinical information. **INITIALS\n"

CD38 is expressed on <30% of clonal B-cells. This\nimmunophenotype and limited morphologic findings are characteristic for\nchronic lymphocytic blood cancer (CLL).  If the patient does not have a\npreviously established diagnosis of CLL/SLL, the current requirement for\nthis diagnosis includes an absolute monoclonal B-cell count >5 x 10(9)/L,\nor the presence of extramedullary tissue involvement, cytopenias or disease\nrelated symptoms (WHO classification 2008).  The alternative diagnosis is\nmonoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis (MBL) with a CLL-like phenotype, which has\nbeen shown to progress to CLL requiring therapy at a rate of \\R\\1% per year\n(Rawstron et al NEJM 2008; **ID-NUM). If identifying disease criteria for CLL are\nmet, then the absence of CD38 expression is associated with better outcome.\n(Ref. Matrai Z. Hematology 2005;10:39-46; Boonstra JG et al,\n2006;**ID-NUM). Clinical and morphologic correlation is required for\ncomplete interpretation of these findings, with periodic blood monitoring\nrecommended if clinically warranted.\n\nMORPHOLOGY:\nThe cytospin preparation shows a prominent population of small and\nintermediate lymphocytes with mature chromatin. Unremarkable neutrophils\nare observed with subsets of monocytes and occasional eosinophils.\n\nFLOW CYTOMETRY:\nThe following antigens were examined: CD3  CD4  CD5  CD8  CD10  CD19  CD20\nCD23  CD33  CD34  CD38  CD45  FMC7  kappa  lambda\n\nBlasts:\nNo significant increase in CD34+ blasts identified.\n\nLymphoid population:\nSurface immunoglobulin negative B-cell population identified, see comment\nabove. These cells do not express CD10 or FMC7.\n\nApproximately 13% of total events are mature T-cells with a normal CD4:CD8\nratio of 4:1 and normal pan T-cell antigen expression with the antibodies\nexamined.\n\nMyeloid/monocyte populations:\nThe majority of recorded events are CD33 positive maturing myeloid cells.\n\nMonocytes identified by forward and side scatter characteristics, in\nconjunction with CD4 and CD33 coexpression, comprise 2% of total events.\n\n\nIf images are listed within this report, they can be viewed by authorized\nusers on **WEB-LOC, Pathology Express.\n\nThis test was developed and its performance characteristics determined by\nXXXXX.  It has not been cleared or approved by the\nU.S. Food and Drug Administration.  The FDA has determined that such\nclearance or approval is not necessary.  This test is used for clinical\npurposes.  It should not be regarded as investigational or for research.\nThis laboratory is certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement\nAmendments of 1988 (CLIA) as qualified to perform high complexity clinical\ntesting.\n\nThe staff pathologist was present during the formal review and\ninterpretation of all slides and ancillary studies (if performed) with the\nmedical student or resident.\n\n\n\n\n**NAME[ZZZ YYY] XXX], PhD\nXXXXX Hematopathologist\nElectronically signed **DATE[Oct 13 2012] 05:34 PM\nSPECIMEN:\n\n\nReferral ID #:\n# Unstained Slides:\n# Stained Slides:\n# Blocks:\nSpecimen Type:      Peripheral Blood\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA: CD5 vs CD19, B-cells shown\nA: CD5 vs CD23, All events shown\nA: Kappa vs lambda\nA: CD5 vs CD19, B-cells shown: An atypical B-cell population is identified\nthat coexpresses CD5 and CD19.\nA: CD5 vs CD23, All events shown: The atypical B-cells (red) are also\npositive for CD23.

Electronically Signed: **DATE[Feb 15 2012]\n<SPECIMEN(S)>\n  A) Right lung mass tissue posterior core bx\n<GROSS>\n  Received in a container labeled with the patient's name and \"right\nposterior lung mass\" is a 1.7 cm white-tan wispy tissue core, AE/(1).\n<MICROSCOPIC>\n  Sections show a core of pulmonary parenchyma infiltrated by a poorly\ndifferentiated squamous cell malignant epithelial tumor. Tumor cells grow in nested sheets\nlike groups and are composed of cells with enlarged moderate pleomorphic\nnuclei often with one or more prominent nucleolus. The cells have variable\namounts of amphophilic cytoplasm. In some areas there is a suggestion of\nintercellular bridges between some cells. Areas of the tumor are necrotic.\nOther areas are surrounded by dense fibrous tissues. \nA panel of immunohistochemical marker stains has been performed. This\nconfirms a squamous phenotype for this neoplasm. The neoplastic cells show\ndiffuse and strong positive immunoreactivity for cytokeratin 5/6. There is\npositive nuclear immunoreactivity for p63. These same cells are negative\nwith stains for cytokeratin 7, cytokeratin 20, TTF-1 and CDX2. Appropriate\ninternal controls are preset on some of these negative stains. \nIMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY (IHC) REPORT:\nANTIBODIES:RESULTS: \n1.   CYTOKERATIN 7 (OV-TL12/30): NEGATIVE.\n2.  CYTOKERATIN 20 (Ks20.8): NEGATIVE.\n3.  CYTOKERATIN 5/6 (D5&16B4): POSITIVE.\n4.  p63 (BC4A4): POSITIVE. \n5. CDX2 (CDX2-88): NEGATIVE. \n6. TTF-1 (8G7G3/1): NEGATIVE. \nFormalin-fixed, deparaffinized tissue sections (along with appropriate\npositive controls) are incubated with the following monoclonal and/or\npolyclonal antibodies. Localization is via a biotin-free multimer-based\nimmunoperoxidase technique according to an optimized protocol. The\ncontrols are reviewed for the appropriate positive and negative reactivity\nand found to be satisfactory. Results on the population(s) of interest are\nas indicated above. \n \nThese tests were developed and their performance characteristics were\ndetermined by the Department of Anatomic Pathology at Group Health\nCooperative.  The Laboratory is certified under CLIA-88 and is qualified\nto perform high complexity testing.  These tests have not been cleared or\napproved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. However, the FDA has\ndetermined that such clearance or approval is not necessary.\n"

There is a 2.5 opened vascular margin (vein) exuding yellow-tan friable tumor.  The surface of the specimen consists of yellow-tan perinephric adipose tissue with focal Gerota's fascia.  The previously mentioned vascular margin is shaved.  The renal artery is identified and appears free of tumor.  The ureter is identified and the margin is shaved.  The ureter measures 9.0 cm in length and is 0.5 cm in diameter and is dissected to the level of the renal pelvis and fails to reveal distinct tumor involvement.  The specimen is marked with black ink and bivalved to reveal the kidney to measure 19.0 x 12.0 x 10.0 cm.  There is a bulky, yellow-tan, partially gelatinous, hemorrhagic tumor mass identified within the kidney.  The tumor completely replaces the lower pole and extends into the upper pole of the kidney.  The tumor measures 15.0 x 10.5 x 10.0 cm.  Tumor grossly appears to involve the renal sinus adipose tissue and fills the calyceal system of the kidney, with tumor calyceal extension noted in the upper pole.  The tumor is located to within less than 0.1 cm of the overlying inked surface.  The uninvolved kidney parenchyma is tan and unremarkable.  The adrenal gland is identified and measures 6.8 x 3.0 x up to 1.0 cm.  There is a 1.1 x 0.9 x 0.9 cm cortical small lump.  The adrenal gland does not appear to be involved by the tumor.

Bone marrow, right posterior iliac crest, aspirate and tissue sampling:\n1.  Normocellular bone marrow (10-20% cellularity), suspicious for involvement by a mature B cell lymphoma (10% of total cells) (see Comment)\n    a.  Rare stainable iron and no increase in ring sideroblasts\n2.  Flow cytometric immunophenotyping demonstrates:\n    a.

Major cell line:  45,X,-Y[3]\n  b.  Minor cell line:  46,XY,del(11)(q14q23)[2]/46,XY[15]\n\nPeripheral blood:\n1.  Mild normochromic, normocytic anemia\nDiagnosisComment:\nPer EPIC, the patient has a prior diagnosis of a CD20-positive, follicular lymphoma, grade 3A out of 3 from a **DATE[Apr 15 12] excisional tissue sampling of left axillary lymphadenopathy. \n\nFor the current bone marrow tissue sampling, the histologic and immunohistochemical findings show scattered, small B cells (10% of total cells).  A rare, loose, paratrabecular lymphoid aggregate is seen (see second photo).  The flow cytometry study identifies an atypical population of small B cells (although light chain restriction is not established).  Lastly, the cytogenetics data demonstrates a deletion in chromosome 11 in a subset of the cells (although this finding is not pathognomonic for any disease).  Collectively, these findings raise the suspicion, but are not definitive for, bone marrow involvement by a CD20-positive mature B cell lymphoma.\n\nWith the available data, a definitive diagnosis of a follicular lymphoma is not currently rendered because of 1)  the low level marrow involvement by the B cells (approximately only 10% of the total cells), 2) lack of a definitive population of light chain-restricted B cells by flow cytometry, 3) lack of a typical histologic pattern with corroborating immunohistochemical staining (i.e., BCL-2, BCL-6), and 4) lack of a typical t(14;18) genetic abnormality by cytogenetics.\nAdditional fluorescence localized tumor hybridization studies and molecular immunoglobulin heavy chain gene rearrangement studies are pending, and these results will be incorporated as Addenda for a final diagnosis.\n\n\nAlso, stainable marrow iron is rare.  If indicated, consider correlation with serologic studies.\n\nPlease also see the concurrent flow cytometry immunophenotyping report (PPPL at HMC **NAME[ZZZ] Flow Cytometry Laboratory, ***PATH-NUMBER[1]) and concurrent cytogenetics report (Ohana Genetics, **ID-NUM). |\nGrossDescription:\nReceived in two containers in fixative labeled \"XXXXXX, XXXXXX\"\n\nA.  Container A labeled \"aspirate clot\" specimen consists of an estimate of 1.5 cc brown blood clot.  Totally submitted in \n  cassette A.\n\nB.  Container B labeled \"bone marrow tissue sampling\" consists of one core tissue sampling of hard tan and brown bone measuring 1.7 cm in \n  length.  Totally decalcified for 5 minutes in TBD-1 decal.  Totally submitted in cassette B.\nA: Bone marrow, aspiration (clot section)\nB: Bone marrow, tissue sampling, right posterior iliac crest\nAddendumDiagnosis:\nA.   Bone marrow, aspiration:  \n    1.    Bone marrow with an atypical B cell population (see Addendum Comment)\n    2.  B cell clonality detection by PCR:  Insufficient DNA isolated (see Addendum Comment)\n    3.    BCL6 rearrangement by FISH:  Not detected\n    4.    IGH/BCL2 translocation by FISH:  Not detected.\nAddendumComment:\nThis Addendum is created to incorporate an additional molecular B cell clonality and fluorescence localized tumor hybridization (FISH) studies.\n\nA B cell clonality detection study (immunoglobulin gene rearrangement) by PCR was conducted to help identify a clonal B cell population.  However, insufficient DNA was isolated; and this study provides no additional data.\n\nFISH studies examining for a BCL6 rearrangement and an IGH/BCL2 translocation were not detected.  \n\nIn summary, 1) the atypical morphologic findings of the bone marrow tissue sampling (i.e., rare paratrabecular lymphoid aggregate with numerous B cells), 2) atypical findings by flow cytometry (i.e. CD5-negative/CD10-negative B cells comprising 40% of lymphocytes/7-8% of total cells and with non-specific light chain staining), and 3) deletion in chromosome 11 in a subset of the cells are all findings which raise the suspicion for involvement by a low-grade mature B cell lymphoma.  However, these findings are not definitive for a diagnosis of malignant tumor.  The additional molecular B cell clonality study and FISH studies do not provide any further support for a clonal B cell population.  \n\nIt is possible that the lack of definitive data is related to sampling or the sensitivity of the molecular and FISH tests.\n\nAs mentioned earlier in the original Comments, a definitive diagnosis of a follicular lymphoma is not currently rendered because of 1) the low level marrow involvement by the B cells (approximately only 10% of the total cells), 2) lack of a definitive population of light chain-restricted B cells by flow cytometry, 3) lack of a identifying disease histologic pattern with corroborating immunohistochemical staining (i.e., BCL-2, BCL-6), 4) lack of a typical t(14;18) genetic abnormality by cytogenetics, and 5) lack of a detectable IGH/BCL2 or BCL6 rearrangement.\n\nPlease also see Clarient reports ***PATH-NUMBER[2] (B cell clonality detection) and ***PATH-NUMBER[3] (FISH studies).\n"

Received in the fresh state for frozen section and designated as \\\"tissue sampling of mass upper lobe left lung\\\" is a somewhat rubbery to fleshy reddish-gray to gray-tan nodular tissue fragment measuring 1.5 x 1.2 x 0.4 cm. The specimen is bisected and submitted in toto for frozen section in 1 block. Material used in frozen section diagnosis was resubmitted in toto for embedding in block A. D: **DATE[Oct 10 2012] - 1704 hours BHT T: **DATE[Oct 10 2012] - 1726 hours B. Received fresh for frozen section diagnosis of bronchial margin and designated \\\"left upper lobe - left lung\\\" are 3 separate segments of pulmonary tissue weighing 230 g in aggregate. The pleural surfaces are wrinkled and a dark reddish-purple. Mild to moderate amounts of subpleural anthracotic pigment deposition are seen. Multiple surgically clipped lines of surgical removal of tissue are seen. The 8 x 5 x 3 cm segment of pulmonary tissue demonstrates disruption of the pleural surface. Approximately 5 mm deep to the pleural surface is a well-circumscribed, lobulated, light tan small lump. The bronchial margin is submitted in block B1. Section of pleura overlying the mass is submitted in block B2. Sections of tissue from the clipped surgical borders of surgical removal of tissue from this segment of pulmonary tissue are submitted in block B3. The mass is very well circumscribed and appears to pop away from the surrounding pulmonary tissue. The mass has overall dimensions of 1.5 x 1 x 0.6 cm. The mass is slightly soft. The cut surface demonstrates a homogeneous, ivory-colored appearance. The mass is submitted in toto in blocks B4 and B5. Areas of tissue death are not grossly identified upon sectioning. Sectioning through the remainder of this segment of pulmonary tissue reveals no additional masses. The cut surface is dark red, and blood oozes upon sectioning. A random section of lung from this segment of tissue is submitted in block B6. The largest segment of pulmonary tissue is 15 x 6 x 0.9 cm. The vascular surgical borders of surgical removal of tissue are submitted in block B7. Surgically clipped lines of resection are seen, and tissue taken from these areas is submitted in block B8. Sectioning through the pulmonary tissue from this segment reveals dark red rubbery tissue. Blood oozes upon sectioning. A random section of lung from this segment is submitted in block B9. Two peribronchial anthracotic lymph nodes are identified, measuring 1.1 x 0.7 x 0.4 cm and 0.6 x 0.4 x 0.4 cm. Tumor is not grossly identified in these lymph nodes. One-half of each lymph node is submitted in block B10. The remaining segment of pulmonary tissue is 8.5 x 3.5 x 2 cm. A surgically clipped line of resection is seen, and tissue from this area is submitted in block B11. Sectioning reveals beefy red tissue. Nodules or masses are not seen. A representative section is submitted in block B12. C. Submitted in formalin and designated \\\"peribronchial lymph node - left\\\" is an anthracotic lymph node measuring 2 x 0.5 x 0.5 cm. A calcified small lump is identified upon bisectioning, and this small lump is 0.5 cm in greatest dimension. The specimen is submitted in toto in block C for decalcification. D. Submitted in formalin and designated \\\"level 5 node\\\" is a 1.8 x 0.6 x 0.4 cm anthracotic lymph node. The specimen is bisected and both halves are submitted in block D. D: **DATE[Oct 11 2012] - 1617 hours T: **DATE[Oct 13 2012] - 1458 hours\nMICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION A. Step sections of the tissue sampling of the mass from the upper lobe of left lung reveal histologic features consistent with typical carcinoid tumor. The tumor is arranged as rounded and angulated nests of cells. Moderate to abundant amounts of granular pink cytoplasm are seen. The nuclei are rather uniform and an occasional inconspicuous nucleolus is seen. Mitotic activity is very low with only a rare mitotic figure identified. Necrosis is not seen. B. Step sections of the bronchial margin of surgical removal of tissue from the left upper lobe of lung reveal no evidence of malignant tumor. The bronchus is lined by ciliated pseudostratified columnar epithelium. The submucosal glands are unremarkable. Sections from the surgically clipped parenchymal surgical borders of surgical removal of tissue reveal no evidence of neoplasia. Many macrophages are seen in the alveolar spaces and many of these macrophages contain anthracotic pigment. Step sections of the left upper lobe of lung mass reveal histologic changes of typical carcinoid. Large groups of cells are seen demonstrating moderate to abundant amounts of granular amphophilic cytoplasm. The nuclei are generally round to oval and demonstrate a stippled chromatin pattern. Mitotic activity is low. Focal nuclear pleomorphism is seen. Necrosis is not identified. The tumor may be seen undermining bronchial mucosa. Immunohistochemical stains performed at Genzyme confirm neuroendocrine differentiation. A random section of lung reveals no evidence of neoplasia. Intra-alveolar bleeding is seen. Scattered foci of anthracotic pigment deposition are seen. Anthracotic laden macrophages may be seen within alveolar spaces. Sections of the vascular surgical borders of surgical removal of tissue reveal no evidence of neoplasia. Sections of the peribronchial lymph nodes reveal 2 out of 2 lymph nodes to be negative for metastatic malignant tumor. There is prominent sinus histiocytosis. Sections from the remaining segments of lung tissue, including the parenchymal surgical borders of surgical removal of tissue, reveal no evidence of neoplasia. Hemorrhage is seen within alveolar spaces. Anthracotic pigment laden macrophages are also seen within alveolar spaces. There is scattered anthracotic pigment deposition. Emphysematous changes are seen with coalescence of alveolar spaces noted. C. Step sections of the left peribronchial lymph node reveal a lymph node demonstrating a hyalinized and calcified small lump compatible with a remote small area of inflammation.

Smears show scant large cells that are morphologically and immunohistochemically similar to malignant cells identified in the pleural effusion specimens (***PATH-NUMBER[1], ***PATH-NUMBER[2], and ***PATH-NUMBER[3]).  Due to scant cellularity, immunohistochemical stains were performed in combination with slides from CSF sample ***PATH-NUMBER[4].  The large cells are positive for TTF-1, CK7, and MOC-31 stains.  Background inflammatory cells are negative for these stains.  Calretinin stain is negative.  The findings are consistent with involvement of CSF by malignant cells of pulmonary glandular cancer origin.\nGrossDescription:\nReceived labeled \"CSF #2\" is 2.0 cc of colorless and clear fluid.  The fluid is centrifuged and the resulting cell pellet is submitted for cytology and cell block (one cassette). \n\n4 PPPL prepared cytospin slides (Pap stained) and 1 cell block (combined with \"CSF #1\" specimen from Microbiology).\nA: Cerebrospinal fluid #2\n"

Block A1 with tumor is used for EGFR mutation analysis **NAME[RRR] MD **PLACE (see previous addendum). Block A2 is used for RRM1. Unstained slides are prepared with the Response Genetics protocol for small biopsies (non-charged, 7 microns, made with PCR precautions).

EGFR mutation analysis in exons 19-21 was negative, therefore the regular cut and mount slides from block A1 will be sent for ALK rearrangement analysis by FISH. No H\\T\\E slide was prepared; however, these cut and mount slides were sandwiched by H\\T\\E slides showing tumor. There is scarring process and chronic inflammation in the sections with intermixed tumor glands and care will be needed to avoid counting these cells; therefore the block is considered to be borderline adequate for FISH analysis.

A few scattered foci of high-grade duct malignant epithelial tumor are present within the 12:00 lesion.  Lymph nodes, post drug treatment for cancer, are negative for spread of cancer.\nGrossDescription:\nA.  Received fresh labeled \"left breast 12 o'clock position\" is an excision of tan-yellow fibroadipose tissue soft tissue measuring 6.5 x 5.4 x 3.2 cm.  Sutures are provided for orientation.  The specimen is inked: superior aspect-orange, inferior-yellow, lateral-red, medial-green, anterior-blue, posterior-black.  The specimen is serially sectioned from medial to lateral revealing a tan-yellow to white fibroadipose tissue cut surface.  A portion of the specimen has an area of bleeding grossly consistent with a previous needle tissue sampling site.  By palpation, adjacent to the previous needle tissue sampling site are multiple firm small lumps measuring up to 0.3 cm in greatest dimension.  No further masses or lesions are grossly identified.  Representative sections are submitted in blocks A1-8.\n\nThe specimen is collected at 1055 on **DATE[Apr 16 12], and placed in formalin at 1130 for a cold ischemic time of approximately 35 minutes and a total fixation time of approximately 7.5 hours.\n\nB.  Received fresh labeled \"breast mass left 10 o'clock position\" is an excision of tan-yellow fibroadipose tissue soft tissue measuring 4.6 x 3.5 x 2.5 cm.  Sutures are provided for orientation.  There is a centrally placed needle.  The specimen is inked: superior aspect-orange, inferior-yellow, lateral-red, medial-green, anterior-blue, posterior-black.  Sectioning reveals a tan-yellow to white fibroadipose tissue cut surface with no grossly identifiable masses or lesions.  Representative sections are submitted in blocks B1-8.  \n\nThe specimen is collected at 1055 on **DATE[Apr 16 12], and placed in formalin at 1130 for a total cold ischemic time of approximately 35 minutes and a total fixation time of approximately 7.5 hours.\n\nC.  Received in formalin labeled \"left axillary contents\" is an excision of tan-pink to yellow fatty soft tissue measuring 7.0 x 4.3 x 2.0 cm.  By palpation, there are multiple firm small lumps closely consistent with lymph nodes.  Five nodes in total are grossly identified measuring up to 1.5 cm in greatest dimension.  Submitted in blocks C1-4.\nMicroscopicDescription:\nA.  An excision of breast demonstrates several residual foci of high-grade duct malignant epithelial tumor in-situ.  No residual infiltrating cancer malignant epithelial tumor is identified (post drug treatment for cancer).  Scattered involutional/post drug treatment for cancer effects are noted, represented by areas of scarring process and hyalinization, and scattered dystrophic microcalcifications.  Margins of excision are free of residual DCIS.\n\nB.  An excision of breast demonstrates no evidence of residual malignant epithelial tumor (post drug treatment for cancer).  There are areas of mild involutional/post drug treatment for cancer change, represented by areas of collagenous scarring process and dystrophic calcifications.  The breast exhibits mild proliferative and non-proliferative fibrofluid-filled sacic changes and focal fibroadenoma formation.\n\nC.  A total of 13 lymph nodes are evident, all negative for spread of cancer (post drug treatment for cancer).\nA: Breast mass, left, 12:00 position (fresh)\nB: Breast mass, left, 10:00 position, long suture lateral, short suture superior (fresh)\nC: Left axillary contents\n"

Entirely submitted in cassettes 1a-1c.Addendum Diagnosis\n<FINAL DX>\n\nBRAIN TUMOR: HIGH GRADE SPINDLE CELL NEOPLASM CONSISTENT WITH METASTATIC SPINDLE CELL MALIGNANT EPITHELIAL TUMOR FROM THE LUNG. IMMUNOHISTOCHEMICAL STUDIES BY PHENOPATH LABORATORIES PENDING, ADDENDUM REPORT WILL FOLLOW.\n**INITIALS<CLINICAL INFO>\nBrain tumor.<ADDENDUM COMMENTS>\nThis case was sent to PhenoPath Laboratories in **PLACE, Washington. Their results are as follows:\n\nBRAIN TUMOR: METASTATIC MALIGNANT TUMOR OF CONNECTIVE TISSUETOID MALIGNANT EPITHELIAL TUMOR, CONSISTENT WITH ORIGIN FROM LUNG (SEE COMMENTS).\n\nCOMMENTS:\nThe results of the immunohistochemistry panel for this poorly differentiated mixed malignant tumor of connective tissuetoid and epithelioid malignant tumor confirm the suspicion of a metastatic malignant epithelial tumor (uniformly positive with pancytokeratins OSCAR), and given the provided clinical history, are considered consistent with a spread of cancer from the patient's known lung malignant epithelial tumor. Spindle cell malignant epithelial tumors of the lung typically show no expression of lung organ-specific markers (such as TTF-1), as exemplified in this particular case. Otherwise, there is no evidence for a skin cancer (negative S100/HMB45), myogenic malignant tumor of connective tissue (negative desmin), vascular malignant tumor of connective tissue (negative CD34), or an astrocytic malignant tumor (negative GFAP).\n\nReference is made to their complete report (***PATH-NUMBER[1]).\n(**INITIALS **DATE[Feb 15 2012])\n<MICROSCOPIC>\nBRAIN TUMOR: \nAll of the tissue is examined on three slides. It shows a partially necrotic high grade spindle cell tumor composed of pleomorphic tumor cells with intervening neutrophils and areas of geographic tumor tissue death. The tumor is similar to the patient's prior lung mass (***PATH-NUMBER[2]). The case will be sent in follow-up to PhenoPath Laboratories for additional immunohistochemical studies and an addendum report will follow.PATHOLOGIST:\nInsalaco S J\n"

Container designation: \"station 11\" --  The specimen consists of a .6\nx .5 x .1.4 cm piece of soft tissue.  The specimen is submitted in its\nentirety for frozen section.  The remainder of the tissue is wrapped and\nresubmitted in its entirety in E1.\nF.   Container designation: \"left lung/bronchial surgical borders\" --  Received\nfresh is a 600 gram left pnemonectomy, with specimen measuring in overall\ndimensions as 24 x 11.5 x 3.5 cm, with multiple staple surgical borders along the\nhilar surface, one measuring 2.3 cm enclosing the mainstem bronchus, this\narea is inked blue.  The staple margin is removed, with the shaved\nbronchial resection margin submitted for frozen section diagnosis and\nentirely resubmitted in cassette F1.  The pleural surface throughout is\nsmooth without puckering, a large tumor mass is palpated along the medial\nanterior surface, this pleural surface is inked green. Sectioning through\nthis nodular area reveals a white/yellow, firm tumor mass measuring 3.5 x\n3.5 x 2.7 cm, appearing well demarcated, at a distance of 0.1 cm of the\noverlying pleural surface, with tumor invading through an area of the\nmainstem bronchial cartilage, partially obliterating the lumen, with tumor\nat a distance of 1.3 cm to the bronchial resection margin. Further\nsectioning reveals possible tumor distal involvement of upper lobe\nbronchus. Sectioning through the remainder of the lung parenchyma reveals\nno other discrete nodular tumor masses with widespread bronchiolar\ndilatations filled with thick yellow mucin plugs.  Portions of tissue are\nsubmitted for the XXXXX, including tumor, tumor\nand leading edge, adjacent uninvolved lung parenchyma, and distant\nuninvolved lung parenchyma.   Representative sections are submitted as\nfollows:  F2, vascular resection surgical borders; F3, two perihilar whole lymph\nnode uninked; F4, three whole perihilar lymph nodes; F5, section of tumor\narea with portion of mainstem bronchus and inked pleural surface; F6, two\nsections of tumor area involving main and upper lobe bronchus; F7, another\nsection of tumor and inked overlying pleura; F8, another section of\npossible tumor involving upper lobe bronchus; F9, tumor, adjacent vessels\nand uninvolved lung parenchyma; F10, three sections of uninvolved lung\nparenchyma with areas of anthracotic pigment with dilated mucin plugged\nbronchi.\nG.   Container designation: \"station 9\" --  The specimen consists of a 2.9\nx 2.2 x .7 cm mass of pink-tan soft tissue.

The microscopic description supports the above diagnoses.\n\nC.  The hematoxylin and eosin-stained sections demonstrate fragments of oxyntic mucosa.  The lamina propria shows a mild increase in neutrophils with rare neutrophils found in the superficial epithelium.  There is an abnormal infiltrate of intermediate-sized cells with hyperchromatic nuclei found in the deeper aspect of the mucosa of one fragment.  These abnormal cells have varying nuclear contour shapes and scant cytoplasm.  Adjacent and interspersed small lymphocytes are present among the abnormal cells.  No mucosal ulceration or tissue death is seen.  Immunohistochemical stains were conducted. The abnormal cells label with CD56 and synaptophysin (weak).  The abnormal cells do not stain with chromogranin A, neuron specific enolase (NSE), Ber-EP4, cytokeratin AE1/AE3, cytokeratin 7, cytokeratin 20, polyclonal CEA, TTF-1, CDX2, PSA, CD45 (LCA), CD3, and CD138 (positive controls intact).  \n\nNote:  Preliminary results were discussed with Dr. **NAME[M. ZZZ] on **DATE[May 22 2012].\nA: Gastric tissue sampling mass, greater curvature\nB: Gastric tissue sampling mass, lesser curvature\nC: Gastric tissue sampling mass, cardia lesser curvature\nAddendumComment:\nThis Addendum is created to incorporate additional immunohistochemical staining results for part C.\n\nFor Part C (cardia lesser curvature), additional immunohistochemical stains were conducted in an attempt to further characterize the neoplasm.  Unfortunately, the small amount of neoplastic cells in the original hematoxylin and eosin-stained sections does not appear in the deeper, immunohistochemically stained tissue sections (conducted for this Addendum), thereby precluding further characterization.  \n\nThe morphologic features and the prior immunohistochemical stains (i.e., CD56 and synaptophysin) suggest a poorly-differentiated neuroendocrine neoplasm, favoring small cell malignant epithelial tumor.  However, in the absence of a full immunohistochemical work-up, other malignancies (i.e., atypical forms of hematopoietic neoplasms, gastrointestinal stromal tumor) cannot be definitively excluded.\n\nIf indicated, consider submission of more tissue/sampling of tumor to aid the diagnosis.  \n\n\nAddendum Microscopic Description\nFor Part C, additional immunohistochemical staining was conducted to further characterize the neoplasm.  PAX-5, CD20, CD34, CD99 (MIC 2), CD117, TdT, S100, and Ki-67 (positive controls intact) were conducted.  However, no neoplastic cells are present for staining in the deeper tissue sections.\n"

Labeled with name: **NAME[AAA\nBBB].\nA.   Container designation: \"rectosigmoid colon\" --  The specimen consists\nof a 17.5 cm (post-fixation) segment of rectosigmoid colon varying in\ncircumference from 4 to 6 cm with attached fatty tissue measuring up to 6\ncm in maximal thickness.  The radial margin of the specimen consists of\nserosa with epiploic fat for the upper 6.5 cm transitioning to adventitia\nfor the lower 11 cm.  The epiploic fat is inked green and the deep\nadventitia is inked black and blue.  Opening of the bowel demonstrates a\nred to dark brown, circular mass lesion with heaped borders arising in the\nbowel mucosa and measuring 2.7 x 2.5 x 1.4 cm (deep).  The mass is 7 cm\nfrom the closest (distal) margin pre-fixation (3.5 cm post-fixation), 11 cm\nfrom the proximal margin (post-fixation), and 1.7 cm from the\ncircumferential margin (post-fixation).  The mass appears to expand the\nbowel mucosa without invading into the pericolonic adipose tissue.\nApproximately 15 growth protruding from a mucous membranes are identified on the bowel mucosa, both proximal\nand distal to the mass lesion, and measuring up to 0.7 cm in greatest\ndiameter. The remaining bowel mucosa is otherwise unremarkable. Examination\nof the attached pericolonic fat reveals multiple presumed lymph nodes,\nranging from 0.2 to 0.8 cm in greatest diameter.  Cassette summary:  A1 -\nproximal and distal surgical borders, with proximal inked blue and distal inked\nblack; A2  mucosal growth protruding from a mucous membranes; A3   mass lesion with adjacent normal bowel and\nseparate representative section of radial margin; A4-A6 - representative\nsections of mass lesion; A7 - three bisected lymph nodes differentially\ninked; A8 - four lymph nodes entirely submitted; A9 - four lymph nodes\nentirely submitted; A10 - four lymph nodes entirely submitted; A11 - four\nlymph nodes entirely submitted; A12 - five lymph nodes entirely submitted;\nA13 - five lymph nodes entirely submitted.\nINTRAOPERATIVE CONSULT DIAGNOSIS -- RECTOSIGMOID COLON:  TUMOR IS 7 CM FROM\nCLOSEST PERIPHERAL (DISTAL) MARGIN.
