No definite\nglandular or papillary architecture seen. There is a marked admixed\nlymphoplasmacytic infiltrate. Selected slides were reviewed by Dr. **NAME[M. ZZZ]\nwith concurrence.\n\nINTRAOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:\nFSA:  Uterus: Greater than 50% invasion into myometrium. (**INITIALS)\nGROSS DESCRIPTION:  Number of specimen containers: 1.  Received unfixed,\nlabeled with patient name **NAME[AAA BBB] and MRN **ID-NUM.\nA.   The specimen is a 115 gram specimen including uterus measuring 9 x 5 x\n4 cm.  Right fallopian tube measuring 5 cm in length and 0.6 cm in\ndiameter.  Right ovary measuring 2.6 x 2.6 x 1 cm.  Left fallopian tube\nmeasuring 5 cm in length and 0.5 cm in diameter and left ovary measuring\n2.5 x 2 x 1.5 cm.  The endometrium has a tan-pink lining with a 5 x 4 x 2\ncm mass on the anterior and posterior walls.  There appears to be invasion\nof the underlying myometrium to a depth of greater than 75% of the\nmyometrium.  The area of deepest invasion appears to be the posterior lower\nuterine segments where the tumor approaches within 3 mm of the serosal\nsurface.  The myometrium deep to the visible tumor; however, is firm to the\ntouch and extension of the tumor into the myometrium may be greater.  The\nfundus appears to not have tumor involvement.  In the uninvolved uterus,\nthe endometrium measures 1 mm in thickness and the myometrium 2.1 cm in\nthickness.  Bilateral fallopian tubes are patent and have fimbriated ends.\nThe right ovary has a smooth outer surface and is unremarkable on cross\nsection. The left ovary has a smooth outer surface and a single, smooth\nwalled fluid-filled sac measuring 2.5 x 2 x 1.5 cm.  The fluid-filled sac has compressed the\nremaining ovarian tissue to the superior aspects of the ovary.  Cassettes\nsubmitted as follows:  A1   remainder of frozen section; A2   posterior\nvaginal cuff; A3   anterior and posterior cervix, anterior has an inked\nserosal surface, posterior contains a piece of posterior vaginal cuff; A4\nanterior lower uterine segment cut longitudinally; A5   posterior lower\nuterine segment and cervix cut and cross section with tumor closest extent\nto the serosal surface; A6   normal appearing posterior fundus\nfull-thickness; A7   anterior body full-thickness with intramural whorled\nsmall lump; A8   posterior body full-thickness; A9   anterior fundus\nfull-thickness; A10   left lateral parametrial tissue; A11   right lateral\nparametrial tissue; A12   cross section of left fallopian tube and left\novary with fluid-filled sac wall; A13   representative section of left ovary; A14\ncross section of right fallopian tube and right ovary; A15   representative\nsection of right ovary.\nB.

The specimen has been received oriented per the surgeon with a short suture designating the superior resection margin and a long suture designating the lateral resection margin.  The overlying ellipse of lightly pigmented skin is 26.7 cm medial to lateral x 16.2 cm superior to inferior.  The nipple-areolar complex is 9.0 cm in diameter.  The everted nipple is 1.0 x 1.0 x 0.5 cm.  The skin surface is remarkable for a 7.0 cm in length x 0.1 cm in average diameter well-healed surgical scar involving the upper outer quadrant.  Additional skin masses or lesions are not grossly identified.  The specimen is differentially inked in order to allow for the microscopic evaluation of surgical removal of tissue surgical borders in the following manner:  superior-anterior blue, inferior-anterior green, and posterior black.  Sectioning of the mastectomy reveals a 5.5 x 2.5 x 1.5 cm mass within the upper outer quadrant.  This mass comes to within 2.0 cm of the overlying skin, 4.0 cm of the posterior resection margin, 4.0 cm of the nearest superior-anterior resection margin, and 9.0 cm from the nearest inferior-anterior resection margin.  Present within the central aspect of the mass is a metallic clip.  Additional distinct breast masses, lesions or prior tissue sampling sites are not grossly identified.  The remainder of the mastectomy grossly appears to be comprised of approximately 75% yellow glistening adipose tissue and 25% white to pink fibrous tissue.  Dissection of the axillary tail reveals fifteen lymph node candidates ranging in greatest dimension from 0.6 cm to 3.0 cm.  The largest lymph node candidate which represents the highest lymph node within the axillary tail has a cut surface which is remarkable for a white to gray gritty cut surface as well as bleeding and tissue death.  This lymph node grossly appears to have been previously biopsied.  The identified lymph nodes are submitted in their entirety.  SUMMARY OF SECTIONS:  A1 nipple, A2 skin scar found on upper outer quadrant, A3-A6 mass from upper outer quadrant, A7 mass from upper outer quadrant with overlying skin, A8 superior-anterior resection margin of breast mass, A9 inferior-anterior resection margin of breast mass, A10 posterior resection margin of breast mass, A11 uninvolved breast tissue from upper inner quadrant, A12 uninvolved breast tissue from lower inner quadrant, A13 uninvolved breast tissue from lower outer quadrant, A14 uninvolved breast tissue from upper outer quadrant, A15 six intact lymph nodes, A16 six intact lymph nodes, A17 one lymph node bisected, A18-A19 largest and highest lymph node within axillary tail serially sectioned.\n**INITIALS  **DATE[Jun 12 12]\n\n<MICROSCOPIC>\nH&E-stained sections examined.  Slide A18 shows an involved lymph node, 1.7 cm in greatest dimension.  Tumor is identified outside of the lymph node capsule.  This may represent extracapsular lymph node extension, tumor tracking along the previous tissue sampling site, or direct tumor extension into the lymph node. \nThis case has undergone prospective intradepartmental quality assurance review prior to verification.\nAK/cs  **DATE[Jun 13 12]\n\n\n<FINAL DX>\nBREAST, LEFT, RADICAL MASTECTOMY, INCLUDING SKIN, NIPPLE AND AXILLARY TAIL:\n  INFILTRATING CANCER DUCTAL MALIGNANT EPITHELIAL TUMOR WITH THE FOLLOWING FEATURES:\n  1.

The absence of an ALK rearrangement suggest that the patient may not respond to ALK \n    inhibitors.  Clinical correlation is suggested.\n\n    Reference range:\n    Not Detected:  Less than or equal to 15% of cells with split signals (3  ALK and 5  ALK signals apart by greater \n    than 2 times signal size or single 3  ALK signal) in 50 cells scored.\n    Detected:  Greater than 15% of cells with split signals (3  ALK and 5  ALK signals apart by greater than 2 times \n    signal size or single 3  ALK signal) in 50 cells scored.\n\n    Methodology:\n    After deferring the tumor area on an H\\T\\E slide form this formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) patient \n    specimen, ALK gene rearrangement was assessed utilizing the LSI ALK Dual Color, Break Apart Probe assay \n    (**NAME[WWW] Molecular).  The identification probes for LSI ALK 5  probe (SpectrumGreen) and LSI ALK 3  probe \n    (SpectrumOrange) were hybridized according to the manufacturer s guidelines.  At least 50 non-overlapping \n    nuclei were analyzed and the localization of the LSI ALK 5  probe (green) and LSI ALK 3  probe (orange) signals \n    were recorded and interpreted.\n\n    Intended Use:\n    The LSI ALK (Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase) dual Color, Break Apart Rearrangement Probe (Abbot Molecular) is \n    designed to detect rearrangements of the ALK gene.  Fusion of the ALK gene with the echinoderm microtubule-\n    associated protein-like 4 gene (EML4-ALK) can be detected in a subset of non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC).  \n    EML4-ALK fusion is observed primarily in lung glandular cancer.  Patient s who harbor this mutation may \n    respond to ALK inhibitors.  Nature 448, 561-566 (2 **DATE[Sep 2007]).

Received fresh for intraoperative consultation, labeled \"sigmoid colon,\" is a resected segment of tan-pink intestinal tissue measuring 15.5 cm in length x 3.0 cm average outside diameter.  One margin is received stapled.  The serosal surface is smooth and tan-pink, with a retracted area on the antimesenteric side, measuring 1.3 cm in greatest dimension.  Opening reveals a tan-pink mucosa with a tan-pink to red lesion measuring 4.0 x 2.5 x 1.3 cm, located 4.0 cm from the stapled margin, >7.0 cm from the open margin.  Sectioning through the lesion reveals gross invasion of the muscle layer with no gross invasion of the surrounding fat.  No further masses or lesions are grossly identified.  Representative sections are submitted in blocks A1-A14.  \n\n  SECTION SUMMARY:\n  A1  -  Stapled margin\n  A2  -  Open margin  \n  A3-A6  -  Sections through lesion\n  A7-A10  -  Lymph nodes\n  A11-A14-  Additional node dissection\n\nB.  Received fresh for intraoperative consultation, labeled \"cecal growth protruding from a mucous membrane,\" is an excision of tan-pink soft tissue measuring 1.4 x 10 x 0.3 cm.  The specimen is submitted for a frozen section and subsequently submitted in block B.\n\nC.  Received in formalin labeled \"colon donuts\" are two ring-shaped fragments of tan-pink intestinal tissue measuring, in aggregate, 2.4 x 2.2 x 2.2 cm. Representative sections are submitted in blocks C1-C2.\n\nD.  Received in formalin labeled \"appendix\" is a tan-pink appendix measuring 5.3 cm in length x 0.7 cm average outside diameter.  The serosal surface is smooth and tan-pink.  Sectioning reveals a constricted lumen and grossly normal mucosa.  Representative sections are submitted in block D.\n\nE.  Received in formalin labeled \"cecum staple line\" is a segment of tan-pink intestinal tissue measuring 3.5 x 1.1 x 1.1 cm.  There is a suture line seen along the long axis of the specimen.  A representative section is submitted in block E.\nMicroscopicDescription:\nA.  Proximal and distal surgical borders are free of malignant epithelial tumor.  The mucosal mass is an infiltrating cancer, moderately-differentiated glandular cancer invading into, but not through, the muscularis propria.  Some nests of tumor exhibit surrounding retraction artifact, but distinct vascular infiltration by cancer is not identified.  Initial dissection demonstrates only eight small lymph nodes/lymphoid aggregates, all negative for spread of cancer.  Additional dissection for nodes demonstrates seven additional nodes, all negative for spread of cancer, for a total of 15 nodes, all negative for spread of cancer. \n\nB.  Sections of colonic mucosa and submucosa demonstrate a sessile hyperplastic growth protruding from a mucous membrane.  Margins of the mucosal resection appear free of growth protruding from a mucous membrane.  There is moderate chronic inflammation with scattered reactive lymphoid aggregates.  \n\nC.  Sections of donuts demonstrate non-cancerous colonic mucosa.  \n\nD.  Sections of appendix are free of acute inflammation.  \n\nE.  Sections of colon exhibit a small, 0.3 cm adenomatous growth protruding from a mucous membrane.\nA: Sigmoid colon\nB: Cecal growth protruding from a mucous membrane\nC: Colon donuts\nD: Appendix\nE: Cecum staple line\n"

The specimen averages 5.0 cm in diameter.  There is an attached 7.0 x 0.6 cm appendix..  Also attached is a 10.5 cm segment of terminal ileum averaging 2.8 cm in diameter.  Attached to the outside edge toward the distal resection margin is a 20.0 x 15.0 x 1.0 cm soft yellow unremarkable portion of omentum.  On opening the specimen located 14.5 cm distal to the ileocecal valve and approximately 20 cm distal to the proximal ileal margin with extension to within 15 cm of the distal colon margin is a circumferential raised tan red focally ulcerated and lobulated tumor mass which involves the full wall thickness with extension to within less than 1 mm of the serosal which will be inked in blue.  The tumor measures up to 3.5 cm in thickness, approximately 6.0 x 6.0 cm in cross dimensions.  The tumor is grossly situated 3 cm away from the closest fatty vascular pedicle radial margin.  Also noted 2.5 cm proximal to the edge of the tumor on the mucosa is a raised tan red 0.5 cm growth protruding from a mucous membrane.  Also there appears to be some black dye injected into the colon wall at the site of the tumor.  On sectioning the appendix there is a lumen varying from 0.1-0.2 cm in diameter and a wall varying from 0.2-0.4 cm in thickness.  No area of rupture is identified.  The remaining colon and ileal mucosa is tan pink with no additional gross lesions identified.

The node was entirely submitted.\n\nTOUCH PREP DIAGNOSIS: NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT EPITHELIAL TUMOR\n\nPART 2: RIGHT BREAST\n(**INITIALS) Received in formalin labeled **NAME[AAA BBB], designated \"\"right breast, suture marks axillary\"\" is an apparent simple mastectomy specimen weighing 430 grams and measuring 20 cm medial-lateral, 16.5 cm superior-inferior and up to 3 cm anterior-posterior. The axillary area of the excision is marked with a suture on the container label and requisition form. The specimen is also surmounted by an elliptoid portion of yellow-pink skin measuring 15.5 x 8.5 cm. The nipple is everted measuring 1.4 cm. The skin is notable for two red-maroon, flat, discolored lesions, each measuring 0.2 cm in greatest dimension. The specimen is inked as follows: superior-green, inferior-orange, medial-red, lateral-purple, and deep posterior-black. Sectioning the breast reveals a solid, firm, suspicious-appearing neoplasm in the central superior aspect of the excision. The lesion measures 2.2 x 2 cm. It is removed from the cutaneous and inked soft tissue margin. The nearest inked margin to the lesion are the green and black inked soft tissue margin at a distance of 1.5 cm each. The lesion on cut section features solid hemorrhagic areas, along with a deeply embedded metallic clip. The remainder of the breast tissue parenchyma is composed mainly of bright yellow fatty tissue with strips of pink-white fibrous tissue. No other suspicious mass is grossly appreciated. Thorough examination of the superior-lateral most aspect of the excision reveals two lymph node/small lumps measuring 0.6 and 1.9 cm in greatest dimension which are fat replaced on cut section. \n\nSummary of sections: 2a-sections skin and nipple; 2b-green inked soft tissue margin close to breast lesion; 2c-black inked soft tissue margin close to breast lesion; 2d through 2f-representative sections breast lesion central superior breast; 2g, 2h-sections upper outer quadrant of breast; 2i, 2j-sections lower outer quadrant of breast; 2k, 2l-sections upper inner quadrant of breast; 2m, 2n-sections lower inner quadrant of breast; 2o-two bisected axillary lymph nodes/small lumps\n \nPART 3: HIGHEST LEFT AXILLARY NODE \n(**INITIALS) Received in formalin labeled **NAME[AAA BBB], designated \"\"highest left axillary node\"\" is a portion of fatty yellow tissue measuring 1.4 x 1 x 0.3 cm. Trimming of this fatty tissue reveals two somewhat matted lymph nodes. Entirely submitted in cassette 3a. \n \nPART 4: LEFT MODIFIED MASTECTOMY \n(**INITIALS) Received in formalin labeled **NAME[AAA BBB], designated \"\"left modified mastectomy, suture marks axilla\"\" is a modified radical mastectomy specimen weighing 457 grams. The axillary tail is marked with a suture. The breast tissue portion measures 15.5 cm medial-lateral, 15 cm superior-inferior and up to 4 cm anterior-posterior. The axillary tail measures 8 x 6 x 1.5 cm. The specimen is surmounted by an elliptoid portion of yellow-pink skin measuring 16 x 8.5 cm. The nipple is everted measuring 1.3 cm. The 4 to 8 o'clock aspect of the areola complex has a purple-red discoloration. Otherwise, no skin lesion is grossly appreciated. The specimen is inked as follows: superior-green, inferior-orange, medial-red, lateral-purple, deep posterior-black. Sectioning the breast reveals an ill-defined malignant appearing neoplasm in the central upper outer quadrant of the breast. The lesion measures 3 x 2.2 cm. The lesion has a solid, smooth, yellow-white cut surface with strips of hemorrhagic areas. The lesion is also remote from the cutaneous and inked soft tissue surgical borders. The nearest inked surgical borders of the lesion are the green and black inked soft tissue surgical borders with a distance of 1 cm each. The rest of the breast tissue parenchyma is composed of bright yellow fatty tissue alternating with pink-white, fibrous tissue. No other suspicious mass is grossly appreciated. Thorough examination of the attached axillary tail reveals several lymph nodes ranging from 0.3 up to 2.8 cm in greatest dimension. \n\nSummary of sections: 4a-sections of skin and nipple; 4b-sections green and black inked soft tissue surgical borders close to breast lesion; 4c, 4d-representative sections breast lesion; 4e, 4f-additional representative section of breast lesion divided in two blocks; 4g, 4h-section upper inner quadrant of breast; 4i, 4j-sections lower inner quadrant of breast; 4k, 4l-upper outer quadrant of breast away from breast lesion; 4m, 4n-sections lower outer quadrant of breast; 4o-multiple intact lymph nodes; 4p-two bisected nodes; 4q, 4r-one bisected lymph node each block; 4s-representative cross section largest axillary node.<DIAGNOSIS COMMENTS>\nIntraoperative Consult Dx::\nNONE<MICROSCOPIC>\nPART 1: RIGHT SENTINEL NODE TISSUE SAMPLING \nTouch preps and H&E stained slides examined. \n \nPART 2: RIGHT BREAST \nH&E stained slides and one immunohistochemical stain examined. The slides contain multiple representative sections of a mastectomy. A malignant epithelial tumor is present with associated localized tumor disease. Immunohistochemistry shows the localized tumor component to lack E-cadherin and the infiltrating cancer component to have patchy E-cadherin reactivity. \n \nPART 3: HIGHEST LEFT AXILLARY NODE \nSlide examined. \n \nPART 4: LEFT MODIFIED MASTECTOMY \nSlides examined. An infiltrating cancer malignant epithelial tumor is present which measures 2.3 cm. This malignant epithelial tumor is similar to the previous but shows more ductal morphologic features and has a small component of ductal malignant epithelial tumor localized tumor. E-cadherin is positive. \n\n\n\nNOTE: Some of the tests reported here may have been developed and performance characteristics determined by Laboratories Northwest.

It consists of an oriented fibroadipose tissue tissue fragment weighing 66 grams and \nmeasuring 8.5 cm from superior to inferior, 6.5 cm from medial to lateral and 2.5 cm from \nanterior to posterior. The tail end of a localization guidewire extends centrally from the anterior \naspect. \nWIth the provided orientation the specimen is inked as follows: \nMedial-Red \nLateral-Yellow \nSuperior-Orange \nInferior-Green \nAnterior-Blue \nDeep-Black \n\nThe specimen is serially sectioned from superior towards inferior into 12 slices with the hooked \nend of the guidewire terminating in slice 3. Sectioning reveals an indurated tan-white slightly ill-\ndefined mass occupying slices 6-8 and grossly measuring 1.2 x 1.2 x 1.5 cm. Grossly the \nmass is 0.1 cm from the anterior margin (slice 6), 1.5 cm from the lateral margin, 1.5 cm from \nthe medial margin, 2 cm from the deep margin, 2 cm from the inferior margin and 2.5 cm from \nthe superior margin. The remainder of the specimen shows soft yellow fatty cut surfaces with a \nminimal fibrous component, although there is some dense fibrous tissue laterally adjacent to the \nmass in slice 8 which abuts the inked margin. There are otherwise no definite areas of \nabnormality. \nSections are submitted as follows:A1-Perpendicular sections of slice 1 with superior margin. \nA2-Representative fibrous tissue in slice 4. \nA3-Fibrous tissue superiorly adjacent to mass, slice 5. \nA4-Slice 6, superior extent of mass with nearest inked anterior margin. \nA5-Slice 6, tissue and deep margin posterior adjacent to mass. \nA6-Tissue and medial margin adjacent to mass. \n\nA9-A10-Slice 8, mass in this slice with anterior and lateral surgical borders (one section bisected). \nA11-Slice 9, fibrous tissue inferiorly adjacent to mass. \nA12-Representative perpendicular sections of slice 12 with inferior margin. \n\nPart B is designated 'sentinel nodes 1-3'. It consists of a soft to rubbery yellow-red fatty tissue \nfragment measuring 6 x 3.8 x 1.3 cm. Palpation and dissection of this tissue reveals three soft \nto rubbery yellow-red probable lymph nodes ranging from 1-2.5 cm in maximum dimension. \n\nThe nodes are submitted as follows: \nB1-One node bisected. \nB2-One node bisected. \nB3-B4-One node quadrisected. \n\nPart C is designated 'additional right anterior margin'. It consists of an unoriented rubbery \nyellow-red fatty tissue fragment weighing 4.2 grams and measuring 4 x 3.5 x 1 cm. One aspect \nis slightly coarse and is the assumed old margin and the opposite lobulated assumed new \nmargin is inked blue. The tissue is serially sectioned revealing uniform soft yellow-red fatty cut \nsurfaces with no gross masses or areas of abnormality. The tissue is entirely submitted in C1C3. \n\nPart D is designated 'right breast anterior lateral'. It consists of two unoriented yellow-red fatty \ntissue fragments together weighing 6.6 grams. The fragments measure 3.5 x 1.5 x 0.4 cm and \n5.3 x 2.5 x 1 cm. Each has a slightly coarse flat assumed old margin and the opposite lobulated \nassumed new margin is inked blue. Each fragment is serially sectioned revealing uniform soft \nyellow-red fibroadipose tissue cut surfaces with no gross lesions or areas of induration. The specimen is \nentirely submitted in D1-D5. \nPart E is designated 'right anterior margin'. It consists of a tissue fragment weighing 3.3 grams \nand consists of an elliptical skin fragment measuring 5 x 2 x 1 cm with a 1 cm everted nipple \ncentrally though at one edge. The skin is the new margin and the opposite old/deep margin is \ninked black. The tissue is serially sectioned revealing uniform rubbery tan-white cut surfaces. \nThe tissue is entirely submitted in E1-E3. \n<FINAL DX> \nA.

Received fresh labeled with the patient's name designated 'right axillary sentinel node' is a 2.5 x 1.5 x 1.0 cm fat replaced tan to pink-yellow ovoid lymph node.  This lymph node is bisected and a touch prep is performed yielding the following diagnosis by Dr. **NAME[ZZZ]:  Lymph node, one; negative for malignant epithelial tumor.  The bisected lymph node is submitted in its entirety for permanent sectioning in cassette A1.\nB.  Received in formalin labeled with the patient's name and designated 'right breast tissue' is an oriented right breast lumpectomy measuring 10.5 cm medial to lateral, 7.0 cm superior to inferior, and up to 4.5 cm anterior to posterior.  The specimen has been received oriented per the surgeon with a double suture designating the posterior resection margin, a single suture designating the lateral resection margin, and a localization wire and skin representing the anterior margin.  The overlying ellipse of lightly pigmented skin is 4.5 cm medial to lateral x 1.0 cm superior to inferior.  The skin surface is grossly unremarkable.  A skin mass or lesion is not identified.  The lumpectomy is differentially inked in order to allow for the microscopic evaluation of the surgical removal of tissue surgical borders in the following manner:  The superior resection margin is inked blue, the inferior resection margin is inked green, the medial resection margin is inked violet, the lateral resection margin is inked orange, the anterior resection margin is inked yellow, the posterior resection margin is inked black.  Sectioning of the lumpectomy reveals a gritty white to pink-gray 1.0 x 0.8 x 0.7 cm mass within the anterior-inferior aspect of the lumpectomy.  A spring-like metallic clip is embedded within the mass.  The mass comes to within 0.8 cm of the anterior resection margin, 1.0 cm of the inferior resection margin, 1.5 cm of the superior resection margin, and 2.0 cm of the posterior resection margin.  The mass does not grossly appear to involve the overlying skin ellipse.  Additional distinct breast masses or lesions are not grossly identified.  The remainder of the lumpectomy is comprised of approximately 75% yellow glistening adipose tissue and 25% white to pink fibrous tissue.  The identified mass is submitted in its entirety.  Summary of sections:  B1 medial resection margin, B2 and B3 bicomposite section of uninvolved breast medial to mass, B4 and B5 breast mass with anterior and inferior resection surgical borders, B6 breast mass with anterior, skin, and superior resection margin, B7 and B8 bicomposite section of uninvolved breast tissue lateral to breast mass, B9 lateral resection margin.\n**INITIALS  **DATE[Jun 4 12]\n\n<MICROSCOPIC>\nA-B.

Labeled with\npatient name **NAME[BBB, AAA M] and medical record number **ID-NUM.\nA.   Container designation: \"uterus, cervix, ovaries and tubes\" --\nReceived unfixed is a uterus, cervix with attached bilateral adnexa.  The\nuterine weighs 1.72 grams, 11.0 x 6.0 x 5.5 cm.  The serosa is smooth,\npink-tan.  The ectocervix is pink-tan with scattered petechiae and a 1.0 cm\nslit-like os.  The soft tissue surgical borders are inked and sectioning of the\ncervix demonstrates multiple fluid-filled sacs occupied by clear mucoid material\nmeasuring up to 1.6 cm in greatest dimension, and the endocervical canal is\npatent.  The endometrium measures 0.1 cm in thickness, the anterior and\nposterior fundus demonstrate a pink-tan shaggy area measuring 2.0 x 1.5 x\n0.6 cm superficially invading the myometrium. The myometrium measures 3.0\ncm in maximum thickness and the posterior body and lower uterine segment\ndemonstrate a firm trabeculated indurated appearance in the myometrium,\ngrossly measuring 2.2 cm in greatest dimension which appears to be distinct\nfrom the originally described tumor mass.  Representative section of the\nindurated appearance in the myometrium and anterior fundus tumor are\nsubmitted for frozen section, wrapped and submitted for permanent section\nin cassette A1.  An additional section of the posterior body trabeculated\nmyometrium is submitted for frozen section and resubmitted for permanent in\ncassette A2.  The right ovary measures 3.5 x 2.0 x 2.0 cm and sectioning\ndemonstrates a pink-tan mottled stroma with multiple fluid-filled sacs ranging from 0.2\nto 1.5 cm in greatest dimension occupied by variably clear watery to\nsanguinous fluid.  The purple-red fallopian tube with fimbriated end\nmeasures 4.5 cm in length, up to 0.8 cm in external diameter and\ndemonstrates a paratubal fluid-filled sac, 3.2 cm in greatest dimension occupied by\nclear watery fluid.  The left ovary measures 4.0 x 3.0 x 2.5 cm upon\nsectioning demonstrates multiple fluid-filled sacs varying from 0.3 to 1.8 cm in\ngreatest dimension occupied by hemorrhagic material.  The corresponding\npurple-red fallopian tube with fimbriated end measures 4.5 cm in length,\n0.8 cm in external diameter and sectioning demonstrates a pinpoint lumen.\nA paratubal fluid-filled sac is identified measuring 1.0 cm in greatest dimension\noccupied by clear watery fluid.

The surgical margin is inked and\nthe specimen is cross-sectioned along the short axis, wrapped and submitted\nentirely in A1 and A2 with cassette A1 containing the ends of the ellipse.\nB.   Container designation: \"inferolateral margin of prior lumpectomy\" --\nReceived unfixed and oriented by the surgeon is a portion of mammary\ntissue, 11 grams, 5 x 4 x 1.5 cm.  Short and long double sutures identify\nthe superior lateral and deep surgical borders, which are inked as follows:\nsuperior blue, inferior black, deep green, previous tissue sampling cavity yellow,\nmedial red.  The specimen is cross-sectioned along the short axis\ndemonstrating a parenchyma comprised predominantly of yellow glistening\nadipose tissue (80%) interspersed with gray fibrous tissue (20%) and in the\narea of the previous tissue sampling cycle then yellow flecks.  The specimen is\nsubmitted entirely and sequentially from superior to inferior in cassette\nB1-B12.\nC.   Container designation: \"superior margin of prior lumpectomy left\nbreast\" --  Received unfixed and oriented by the surgeon is a portion of\nmammary tissue 11 grams, 5 x 3.5 x 2.0 cm.  The superior short long and\ndouble sutures identify the superior lateral and deep surgical borders respectively.\nThe surgical borders are inked as follows:  Superior blue, lateral orange, deep\ngreen, previous tissue sampling site yellow.  Careful sectioning demonstrates yellow\nglistening homogenous cut surfaces throughout.  No discrete lesions are\ngrossly identified.  The specimen is submitted entirely and sequentially\nfrom superior towards inferior.\n\n(Dictated by: **NAME[ZZZ YYY], PA) (Resident:  **NAME[XXX WWW], MD)\nMICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION: Histologic examination performed.\n\nThe staff pathologist was present during the formal review and\ninterpretation of all slides and ancillary studies, (if performed), with\nthe medical student or resident.\n\n\n\n**NAME[VVV UUU] TTT] PhD\n\nElectronically signed **DATE[May 27 2012] 06:13 PM\nSPECIMENS SUBMITTED:\nA.

MHB/mbc\nGross Description Specimen 1 received in formalin labeled left breast is a 960 gram, 24.0 x 19.0 x 6.0cm intact left simple mastectomy specimen.  The specimen is partially surfaced by 17.0 x 9.0cm tan wrinkled skin ellipse.  The everted nipple measures 1.5cm in diameter.  The surgical borders are inked as follows: superficial margin  black, deep margin  blue, and sectioning reveals a 1.8 x 1.5 x 1.5cm ill-defined tan firm mass, 2.8cm from the deep margin and 2.4cm from the superficial margin.  The mass is located in the upper inner quadrant.  There is an area of firm nodular fibrofluid-filled sacic breast tissue located in the lower outer quadrant.  This area is greater than 12.0cm from the primary mass.  No definitive infiltrating cancer tumor is identified in this area.  There are a few small lymph nodes identified in the upper outer quadrant.  Representative sections are placed in formalin at 10:30am.  Summary of Sections: 1A-1B  deep margin closest to mass, 1C  superficial margin closest to mass, 1D-1F  representative sections of primary mass, 1G-1H  representative sections of suspicious breast tissue in lower outer quadrant, 1I  representative section of nipple, 1J  intact axillary lymph nodes. Specimen 2 received in formalin labeled sentinel node are two pieces of fatty tissue each containing a single lymph node.  The smaller node measures 0.8cm in greatest dimension and the larger node measures 1.7cm in greatest dimension.  The nodes are submitted in their entirety separately in cassettes 2A-2B.  **INITIALS\nMicroscopic Description Sections show infiltrating cancer ductal malignant epithelial tumor. The tumor shows low-grade histology with foci of low-grade DCIS. No vascular invasion or marginal involvement is seen. Sections from the separately submitted suspicious area show proliferative fibrofluid-filled sacic changes with prominent intraductal excessive cell growth and papillomatosis. No malignant epithelial tumor is seen.  A few calcifications are seen. The nipple is unremarkable. The three axillary tail lymph nodes show no spread of cancer. The two sentinel lymph nodes are also free of tumor.  MHB/mbc\nAmendments: Electronically Signed Out By **NAME[ZZZ, YYY M]. Procedures/Addenda\n"

There are five lymph nodes identified in the fat\nmeasuring up to 1.0 cm in greatest dimension.  One of the lymph nodes is\nsuspicious for tumor.  The lymph nodes are sectioned, scrape preps made,\nand remainder entirely submitted in blocks A1-A5 to include individual\nsectioned lymph nodes in each cassette.\nFROZEN SECTION DIAGNOSIS   LEFT BREAST SENTINEL LYMPH NODES:  FIVE NODES;\nAT LEAST ONE CONTAINS METASTATIC MALIGNANT EPITHELIAL TUMOR (XX)\nB.   Container designation: \"left breast   The specimen consists of an\noriented (short suture - superior, long suture - lateral), 1060 gram, 22.0\nx 22.0 x 5.0 cm simple left mastectomy surfaced by an unremarkable 27.0 x\n11.5 cm nipple-bearing skin ellipse.  The deep aspect is inked black, the\nanterior aspect is inked blue, and the lateral skin edge is overlaid with\nred ink.  Also, received unattached, separate is a 7.0 x 7.0 x 3.0 cm\naggregate of fat.  There is a 2.6 x 2.4 x 2.2 cm well-circumscribed hard\nmass at 1:00, 9.0 cm from the nipple, and is 0.8 cm from the deep margin\nand >1 cm from the remaining surgical borders.  At the center of the mass, is an\nintraparenchymal metallic marking clip.  There are no other lesions\nidentified and the mastectomy is predominantly fat admixed with a moderate\namount of fibrous tissue (20-25%).  There are no lymph nodes identified at\nthe lateral aspect of the specimen and no lesions underlying the nipple.\nThe separate received aggregate of fat is inked green.  The separate\naggregate of fat contains fibrous bands, but no additional lymph nodes or\nmass lesions.  The remainder of the specimen is unremarkable.  Represented\nin blocks B1-B9 as follows:  B1-B2 tumor, includes closest margin (deep),\nand area of intraparenchymal marking clip; B3 nipple; B4-B7 contains\nfibrous tissue and anterior surgical borders from upper outer, lower outer, lower\ninner, upper inner quadrants, respectively (B4 1:00, 3.0 cm from skin edge,\nB5 5:30, 5.5 cm from skin edge, B6 7:00, 5.0 cm from skin edge, B7 11:00,\n3.5 cm from skin edge).

Container designation: \"3-right breast\"   The specimen consists of an\noriented (short suture   superior, long suture   lateral), 906 gm, 20.0 x\n18.0 x 6.0 cm simple right mastectomy surfaced by 20.0 x 9.0 cm\nnipple-bearing skin ellipse.  Also, received separate is an unattached 6.0\nx 4.0 x 3.0 cm aggregate of lobulated fat.  The deep aspect is inked black,\nthe anterior aspect is inked blue, and the most lateral skin edge is\noverlaid with red ink.  There are no mass lesions identified and the\nspecimen is predominantly fat amidst with a moderate amount of dense,\ngranular fibrous tissue (20-25%).  There are no lymph nodes identified at\nthe lateral aspect of the specimen.  There are no lesions underlying the\nnipple.  The separate aggregate of fat is inked green.  There are no lymph\nnodes or mass lesions identified in the separate received aggregate of fat.\nRepresentative in blocks C1-C10 as follows:  C1-C8 contains fibrous tissue\nand anterior surgical borders from upper outer, lower outer, lower inner, and upper\ninner quadrants, respectively (C1   random, C2   9:30, 3.5 cm from skin\nedge, C3   random, C4   8:00, 4.5 cm from skin edge, C5   random, C6\n5:00, 5.5 cm from skin edge, C7   random, C8   2:00, 4.5 cm from skin edge,\nC9   nipple, C10 representative from aggregate.\nD.

The tumor in other areas shows a somewhat cribriform pattern. In other areas the individual cells, where they appear less cohesive, show large cytoplasmic vacuoles. Microcalcifications are seen within the lesion.  Also noted in the background is a sclerotic papilloma with focal calcifications.  **INITIALS\nAmendments: Amended:  **DATE[Oct 22 2011] by **NAME[XXX WWW VVV] Reason: Immunohistochemical Results      ER/PR Previous Signout Date:  **DATE[Oct 20 2011] Electronically Signed Out By DARON **PLACE Procedures/Addenda Her2Neu **INSTITUTION     Date Ordered:     **DATE[Oct 20 2011]     Status:  Signed Out      Date Complete:     **DATE[Nov 1 2011]     By:  **NAME[UUU TTT]      Date Reported:     **DATE[Nov 1 2011]          Interpretation HER2/CEP17 FISH:       No HER2/Neu gene amplification wash observed for this specimen.

In some cases, it may be helpful to use information about tumor size from imaging studies.  If multiple foci of invasion are present, the size listed is the size of the largest contiguous area of invasion. The size of multiple infiltrating cancer malignant epithelial tumors should not be added together.  The size does not include adjacent DCIS. If there has been a prior core needle tissue sampling or incisional tissue sampling showing a larger area of invasion than in the excisional specimen, the largest dimension of the infiltrating cancer malignant epithelial tumor in the prior specimen should be used for T classification, if known. If there has been prior treatment and no infiltrating cancer malignant epithelial tumor is present, the cancer is classified as Tis if there is residual DCIS and T0 if there is no remaining malignant epithelial tumor.

The skin changes are due to lymphswelling from fluid accumulation caused by tumor emboli within dermal lymphatics, which may or may not be obvious in a small skin tissue sampling.  However, a tissue diagnosis is still necessary to demonstrate an infiltrating cancer malignant epithelial tumor in the underlying breast parenchyma or at least in the dermal lymphatics, as well as to determine biological markers, such as ER, PR, and HER2 status.  Tumor emboli in dermal lymphatics without the clinical skin changes described above do not qualify as inflammatory malignant epithelial tumor.  Locally advanced breast cancers directly invading the dermis or ulcerating the skin without the clinical skin changes and tumor emboli in dermal lymphatics also do not qualify as inflammatory malignant epithelial tumor.  Thus the term inflammatory malignant epithelial tumor should not be applied to neglected locally advanced cancer of the breast presenting late in the course of a patient's disease.  The rare case that exhibits all the features of inflammatory malignant epithelial tumor, but in which skin changes involve less than one-third of the skin, should be classified by the size and extent of the underlying malignant epithelial tumor.  Regional Lymph Nodes (pN) (choose a category based on lymph nodes received with the specimen; immunohistochemistry and/or molecular studies are not required) If internal mammary lymph nodes, infraclavicular nodes, or supraclavicular lymph nodes are included in the specimen, consult the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual1 for additional lymph node categories. Modifier (required only if applicable)      ___ (sn):     Only sentinel node(s) evaluated.  If 6 or more sentinel nodes and/or nonsentinel nodes are removed, this modifier should not be used. Category (pN)      ___ pNX:     Regional lymph nodes cannot be assessed (eg, previously removed, or not removed for pathologic study) __x_ pN0:     No regional lymph node spread of cancer identified histologically      Note: Isolated tumor cell (ITC) clusters are defined as small clusters of cells not greater than 0.2 mm or single tumor cells, or a cluster of fewer than 200 cells in a single histologic cross-section.#   ITCs may be detected by routine histology or by immunohistochemical (IHC) methods.  Nodes containing only ITCs are excluded from the total positive node count for purposes of N classification but should be included in the total number of nodes evaluated.      ___ pN0 (i-):     No regional lymph node metastases histologically, negative IHC ___ pN0 (i+):     Malignant cells in regional lymph node(s) no greater than 0.2 mm and no more than 200 cells (detected by H\\E\\T\\E\\E or IHC including ITC) ___ pN0 (mol-):     No regional lymph node metastases histologically, negative molecular findings (reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction [RT-PCR]) ___ pN0 (mol+):     Positive molecular findings (RT-PCR), but no regional lymph node metastases detected by histology or IHC ___ pN1mi:     Micrometastases (greater than 0.2 mm and/or more than 200 cells, but none greater than 2.0 mm). ___ pN1a:     Metastases in 1 to 3 axillary lymph nodes, at least 1 spread of cancer greater than 2.0 mm ___ pN2a:     Metastases in 4 to 9 axillary lymph nodes (at least 1 tumor deposit greater than 2.0 mm) ___ pN3a:     Metastases in 10 or more axillary lymph nodes (at least 1 tumor deposit greater than 2.0 mm) # Approximately 1000 tumor cells are contained in a 3-dimensional 0.2-mm cluster.  Thus, if more than 200 individual tumor cells are identified as single dispersed tumor cells or as a nearly confluent elliptical or spherical focus in a single histologic section of a lymph node, there is a high probability that more than 1000 cells are present in the node.  In these situations, the node should be classified as containing a microspread of cancer (pN1mi).  Cells in different lymph node cross-sections or longitudinal sections or levels of the block are not added together; the 200 cells must be in a single node profile even if the node has been thinly sectioned into multiple slices.  It is recognized that there is substantial overlap between the upper limit of the ITC and the lower limit of the microspread of cancer categories because of inherent limitations in pathologic nodal evaluation and detection of minimal tumor burden in lymph nodes.  Thus, the threshold of 200 cells in a single cross-section is a guideline to help pathologists distinguish between these 2 categories.  The pathologist should use judgment regarding whether it is likely that the cluster of cells represents a true microspread of cancer or is simply a small group of isolated tumor cells. Distant Metastasis (M)   _x__ Not applicable      ___ cM0(i+):     No clinical or radiographic evidence of distant spread of cancer, but deposits of molecularly or microscopically detected tumor cells

The external surface is yellow-pink, soft and lobulated.  A wire guide is in place.  The specimen is accompanied by radiographs indicating a stellate mass in the center of the specimen with focal calcification. The wire guide appears to pass through the mass.  The external surface is inked blue.  Sectioning reveals a yellow-gray stellate mass in the central aspect measuring 2.2 x 1.7 x 1.2 cm.  Focal tissue death is noted.  The mass has a gritty cut surface consistent with microcalcification.  The mass extends to multiple resection surgical borders.  The remaining cut surface is yellow-pink, soft and lobulated.  A representative section of the stellate mass is submitted for frozen section.  The frozen section remnant is submitted in (block A).  Representative sections of tumor are submitted in (blocks B and C). Representative section of unremarkable breast tissue is submitted in (block D).  Specimen #2 is received in formalin, labeled with the patient's name and designated \"left breast.\"  The specimen consists of a left breast with attached axillary tail.  The breast measures 22.4 x 16.5 x 4.2 cm and weighs 1,031 grams. The attached skin ellipse measures 24.8 x 14.0 cm.  The skin surface is tan-pink with a stapled incision superior of the nipple measuring 5.5 cm in length.  Lateral to the incision is a pink-gray round to oval possible scar measuring 1.0 x 1.0 cm.  Two tan-pink slightly elevated lesions are noted along the superior-medial aspect measuring 0.8 cm in greatest dimension and 0.7 cm in greatest dimension.  The nipple appears unremarkable.  The deep margin is yellow-pink and intact. The deep margin is inked black.  Serial sectioning reveals a recent tissue sampling cavity in the center of the specimen measuring 5.1 x 3.9 x 3.5 cm.  The walls of the cavity are ragged. The tissue surrounding the cavity shows changes of fibrofluid-filled sacic disease.  Biopsy cavity extends to within 1.5 cm of the deep margin.   The axillary tail is dissected and reveals multiple lymph node candidates measuring up to 2.1 cm in greatest dimension.   Representative section of nipple is submitted in (block 2A). Representative sections of skin lesions are submitted in (block 2B). Representative sections of deep margin overlying tissue sampling cavity submitted in (block 2C).  Random sections of tissue sampling cavity are submitted in (blocks 2D through 2F). Representative section of fibrofluid-filled sacic disease is submitted in (block 2G). Random upper outer quadrant submitted in (block 2H). Random lower outer quadrant submitted in (block 2I).  Random upper inner quadrant submitted in (block 2J). Random lower inner quadrant submitted in (block 2K).  Representative sections of lymph nodes are submitted in (blocks 2L and 2M).   **INITIALS\nMicroscopic Description      1.     Sections of tissue sampling of left breast reveals, adjacent to the marker wire, an infiltrating ductal malignant epithelial tumor of breast, grade 2.  The tumor demonstrates a dense desmoplastic stroma with tumor infiltrating the stroma in irregular solid nests, ribbons as well as moderate tubular formation.  Nuclei are moderately enlarged with most showing a distinct nucleolus and stippled to slightly vesicular chromatin pattern.  The tumor demonstrates an intermediate mitotic index with an average of 1 to 2 mitoses per high power field.  Multiple microcalcifications are observed associated with the tumor.  No definitive angiolymphatic invasion by tumor is observed.  Tumor focally abuts against the inked surgical margin of the tissue sampling specimen.   2.     Sections of nipple and areola of mastectomy specimen reveal an unremarkable nipple epidermis showing no evidence of Paget's disease or involvement by tumor.  Subareolar lactiferous ducts are also negative for tumor involvement.  Superficial dermal lymphatics demonstrate no evidence of tumor.  Sections of overlying skin of the breast reveal no evidence of involvement of the epidermis with superficial dermal lymphatics by tumor.  A small seborrheic keratosis is noted.  Also present is an area demonstrating old healed dermal cicatrix.  Sections of the inked deep surgical margin below tissue sampling site reveals a minimum of 1.5 cm of uninvolved fatty breast parenchyma from the inked margin to the site of previous tissue sampling.  Sections of breast tissue surrounding the previous tissue sampling site reveal florid fibrofluid-filled sacic mastopathy including duct ectasia with stasis, fluid-filled sacic duct dilatation with apocrine metaplasia, sclerosing adenosis, blunt duct adenosis, and duct papillomatosis with focal apocrine change.  Multiple microcalcifications are identified associated with fibrofluid-filled sacic mastopathy.  A stellate scar is observed with surrounding complex sclerosing lesion. Adjacent areas of apocrine papillomatosis are identified.  Multiple microcalcifications are observed.  Multiple sections of all adjacent breast quadrants reveal no evidence of additional foci of malignant tumor.  Sections of seven axillary lymph nodes reveal non-cancerous lymph nodes showing no evidence of involvement by primary or metastatic malignant tumor.

Level 3 lymph node, left breast: \nNumber of positive lymph nodes: 0.\nTotal number of lymph nodes examined: 9.\nB. Left breast and axilla: Invasive mammary malignant epithelial tumor with the following characteristics:\n1. Primary tumor size: 4.5 cm.\n2.

Extranodal extension present.\nTotal number of lymph nodes examined: 33 (2 of the 24 lymph nodes in the part B specimen contain isolated tumor cells -- these are not included in the positive lymph node count). \n10. AJCC/ypTN classification: ypT3N3 - stage IIIC, if no distant metastases. \nComment: Much of the tumor consists of fluid-filled sacic spaces lined by neoplastic epithelial cells forming papillary structures. It is difficult, without immunohistochemical stains, to distinguish infiltrating cancer papillary malignant epithelial tumor from intraductal (non-infiltrating cancer) papillary malignant epithelial tumor in some areas. However, much of this appears to be infiltrating cancer neoplasm over the 4.5 cm area of solid to fluid-filled sacic tissue noted grossly.\n \n<PATHOLOGIST>\n**NAME[TTT SSS], M.D.\nAddendum\n<ADDENDUM>\nThe extensive fluid-filled sacic change includes considerable sloughing of epithelial cells, with some areas demonstrating some cell shrinkage and nuclear smudging, which is felt to represent fixation artifact. The majority of the tumor appears viable. There is some scarring process associated with the tumor, but this appears to represent stromal reaction to tumor, rather than fibrous replacement of tumor resulting from drug treatment for cancer.\n \n<PATHOLOGIST>\n**NAME[TTT SSS], M.D.\n**INSTITUTION\n**STREET-ADDRESS                                \nPO Box 50010                                            \n**PLACE, WA **ZIP-CODE                                          **PHONE\n(**PHONE fa\n<CLINICAL INFO>\nLEFT BREAST PAPILLARY MALIGNANT EPITHELIAL TUMOR, METASTATIC TO LEFT AXILLARY LYMPH NODE.

Level 3 lymph node, left breast: \nNumber of positive lymph nodes: 0.\nTotal number of lymph nodes examined: 9.\nB. Left breast and axilla: Invasive mammary malignant epithelial tumor with the following characteristics:\n1. Primary tumor size: 4.5 cm.\n2. Tumor type: Invasive papillary malignant epithelial tumor. \n3. Histologic grade: Intermediate (G2).\nModified Bloom-Richardson Score: 6\nTubular score: 3\nNuclear score: 2\nMitotic score: 1\n4. In situ malignant epithelial tumor: See comment. \n5. Lymphatic/blood vascular invasion: Not identified.\n6. Resection surgical borders: Invasive neoplasm extends to within a fraction of a millimeter of the deep margin of excision (closest margin).\nNeoplasm appears well-away from the other surgical borders of excision. \n7. Estrogen/progesterone receptor and HER-2 studies: Performed on previous tissue sampling (see Laboratories Northwest pathology report ***PATH-NUMBER[1]) and reported as estrogen receptor positive, progesterone receptor negative, and HER-2 negative by immunohistochemistry studies (performed at PhenoPath Laboratories).\n8. Other lesions present: Fibrosis, inflammation, fat tissue death, and hemosiderin deposition - consistent with previous tissue sampling site. \nNegative nipple.\n9. Lymph nodes (including the level 3 lymph nodes from part A, above): \nNumber of positive lymph nodes: 10. Extranodal extension present.\nTotal number of lymph nodes examined: 33 (2 of the 24 lymph nodes in the part B specimen contain isolated tumor cells -- these are not included in the positive lymph node count). \n10. AJCC/ypTN classification: ypT3N3 - stage IIIC, if no distant metastases. \nComment: Much of the tumor consists of fluid-filled sacic spaces lined by neoplastic epithelial cells forming papillary structures. It is difficult, without immunohistochemical stains, to distinguish infiltrating cancer papillary malignant epithelial tumor from intraductal (non-infiltrating cancer) papillary malignant epithelial tumor in some areas. However, much of this appears to be infiltrating cancer neoplasm over the 4.5 cm area of solid to fluid-filled sacic tissue noted grossly.\n \n<PATHOLOGIST>\n**NAME[TTT SSS], M.D.\nAddendum\n<ADDENDUM>\nThe extensive fluid-filled sacic change includes considerable sloughing of epithelial cells, with some areas demonstrating some cell shrinkage and nuclear smudging, which is felt to represent fixation artifact. The majority of the tumor appears viable. There is some scarring process associated with the tumor, but this appears to represent stromal reaction to tumor, rather than fibrous replacement of tumor resulting from drug treatment for cancer.\n \n<PATHOLOGIST>\n**NAME[TTT SSS], M.D.\n**INSTITUTION\n**STREET-ADDRESS                                \nPO Box 50010                                            \n**PLACE, WA **ZIP-CODE                                          **PHONE\n(**PHONE fax\n"

The serosal surface is smooth and glistening.  A fecalith is not identified, however there is a yellow tan area in the lumen measuring up to 0.7 x 0.5 x 0.2 cm and this portion is submitted. Appendix measurement: 7 cm in length x 0.8 cm in diameter Lumen diameter: up to 0.5 cm  Perforation: no The specimen is entirely submitted in A1-A5. ksl/**DATE[May 1 2012] E.A. Pirruccello, DO J.G. Combs\nMICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION      Per the technician who grossed the specimen, the lesion was located about three centimeters from the proximal surgical margin (although an exact measurement was not given).  The margin was not submitted separately, and therefore the true surgical borders cannot be assessed.      A Ki-67 immunohistochemical stain was performed, and is positive in less than 2% of tumor cells.  This case was reviewed at the Intradepartmental Consensus Conference.      The case was discussed with Dr. **NAME[VVV UUU] by Dr. **NAME[WWW] on **DATE[May 7 12].

The specimen consists of five yellow-tan fibroadipose tissue tissue cores, which are each 0.1 cm in diameter, and range in length from 0.6 to 1.5 cm.  The specimen is submitted in toto in single cassette.  The following times are given on the requisition:  S - 11:05 a.m., E - 11:20 a.m., F - 11:10 a.m. on **DATE[Jul 04 2012].  JAB:jck\nMicroscopic Description: Sections of the core tissue sampling demonstrate infiltrating malignant glands set within hyalinized stroma (tubular score: 2) which exhibit mild to moderate nuclear atypia (nuclear score: 2).  Mitotic activity is sparse (mitotic score: 1).  No localized tumor malignant epithelial tumor is seen.  The diagnosis of malignant epithelial tumor is supported by the failure of immunoperoxidase staining for smooth muscle myosin heavy chain and P63 to demonstrate myoepithelial cells.  A few scattered microcalcifications are noted within the tumor. No lymph-vascular space invasion is seen.  The tumor measures up to 0.7 cm in greatest linear extent in this material. A second pathologist has reviewed this case and agrees with the above interpretation.

Segment of terminal ileum in continuity with cecum and ascending colon: \nInvasive glandular cancer \nSpecimen: Terminal ileum, cecum and ascending colon with appendix. \nProcedure: Right hemicolectomy. \nTumor site: Cecum. \nTumor size: 2.5 cm in greatest dimension. \nMacroscopic tumor perforation: Not identified. \nHistologic type: Intestinal, NOS. \nHistologic grade: Moderately differentiated (2/3). \nMicroscopic tumor extension: Through muscularis propria and the pericolonic soft \ntissues. \n\n \n\n<FINAL DX> (Continued) \nMargins: Free (proximal, 7.0 cm; distal, 15.5 cm). \nTreatment effect: Not applicable. \nLymph-vascular invasion: Not identified. \nPerineural invasion: Not identified. \nTumor deposits: Not identified. \nLymph nodes: Ten mesenteric lymph node negative for metastatic malignant tumor (0-10). \nOther: Multiple tubular adenomata; one sessile serrated growth protruding from a mucous membrane. \nAJCC (7th ed.) pathologic stage: pT3 pN0. \nThis case has been subjected to review by a second pathologist per departmental quality \nassurance (QA) policy. \n**INITIALS \n\n<GROSS> \nReceived in two formalin-filled containers labeled '**NAME[BBB, AAA M]. H000730173' and a \nrequisition with '**NAME[BBB, AAA M]. H000730173'. \nThe first is designated 'mesentery small lump' and is a tan-red, firm small lump with attached \nyellow, roughened fat. The small lump measures 2.5 x 1.7 x 1.0 cm. The specimen is inked blue \non the external surface and is quadrisected revealing yellow-brown, granular cut surfaces. \nSectioning and palpation through the remaining fat reveals three tan-yellow, firm small lumps \nmeasuring 0.5, 0.6 and 1.1 cm in greatest dimension. Representative sections submitted in \nfive cassettes. \nSummary of Sections: \nA1-A4 Quadrisected firm large small lump, blue-inked \nA5 Three smaller small lumps found in attached fat \nThe second is designated 'right colon' and consists of a segment of colon with attached \nterminal ileum. The colon measures 20.0 cm in length and up to 8.5 cm in circumference. \nThe terminal ileum measures 6.5 cm in length and up to 3.0 cm in circumference. There is \nattached yellow-red pericolic fat. The serosal surface is smooth and purple. Both ends are \nstapled closed. The proximal margin is inked blue, the distal margin is inked green. \nOpening the colon reveals a well-circumscribed, tan-pink tumor with rolled up borders \nmeasuring 2.5 x 2.5 cm which is 7.0 cm from the proximal margin and 15.5 cm from the distal \nmargin. The fat overlying the tumor is inked black. Sectioning through the tumor reveals \nthat the tumor involves but does not grossly extend through the muscularis propria. The \ntumor abuts the ileocecal valve. The remaining mucosa is soft, tan-pink mucosal folds with \napproximately eight tan-pink possible growth protruding from a mucous membranes ranging from 0.3 to 1.0 cm in greatest \ndimension. These growth protruding from a mucous membranes are found throughout the colon, the closest one approximately 3.5 \ncm from the distal margin. Sectioning and palpation of the attached pericolic fat reveals \n15 possible lymph nodes. The lymph nodes range from 1.1 cm to 0.3 cm in greatest dimension. \nEight lymph nodes are found adjacent to the tumor toward the proximal margin. \nAttached to the cecum is a vermiform appendix measuring 4.0 cm in length and 0.5 cm in \ndiameter. Sectioning reveals a lumen containing light tan, pale-pink fecal material. No \n\n \n\n<GROSS> (Continued) \nfecalith or perforations are grossly identified. \nSummary of Sections: \nB1-B3 Sections of tumor \nB4 Section of tumor showing adjacent mucosa toward proximal margin \nB5 Section of tumor showing adjacent ileocecal valve \nB6-B8 Polyps (B6 contains bisected largest growth protruding from a mucous membrane) \nB9 Representative sections of grossly normal mucosa \nB10 Sections of resection margin \nB11 Appendix \nB12 Bisected lymph node adjacent to tumor \nB13 Bisected lymph node adjacent to tumor \nB14 Two intact nodes adjacent to tumor, one inked blue \nB15 Bisected lymph node adjacent to tumor \nB16 Bisected lymph node adjacent to tumor and one intact node (intact node inked \nblue) \nB17 Trisected lymph node adjacent to tumor \nB18 Four intact lymph nodes away from tumor \nB19 Two intact lymph nodes away from tumor (one node inked blue) \nB20 Bisected lymph node away from tumor \n**INITIALS \n\n<MICROSCOPIC> \nMicroscopic examination supports the final diagnosis.\n"

Specimen 1 consists of:   Pieces:  One   Aggregate dimensions:  0.3 x 0.2 x 0.1 cm.   Cassettes:  One, entirely submitted.   Specimen 2 consists of:   Pieces:  One   Aggregate dimensions:  0.4 x 0.2 x 0.1 cm.   Cassettes:  One, entirely submitted.   Specimen 3 consists of:   Pieces:  Two   Aggregate dimensions:  0.4 x 0.3 x 0.1 cm.   Cassettes:  One, entirely submitted.   Specimen 4 consists of a tan soft growth protruding from a mucous membraneoid tissue fragment measuring   1.0 x 1.0 x 0.8 cm. The surgical surgical borders are inked blue. The specimen   is trisected with fragments upon sectioning and submitted in its   entirety in a single cassette. **INITIALS\nMICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION:   Sections of the first specimen, labeled duodenum, shows small bowel   mucosa with prominent Brunner's glands and a normal villous   architecture with a normal crypt to villous ratio.  The lamina propria   exhibits the normal complement of mononuclear cells.  Focally the   epithelium shows gastric metaplasia.  There is no increase in   intraepithelial lymphocytes and the collagen table is of normal   thickness.  No small area of inflammations or parasites are seen.  There is no evidence   of abnormal cell growth or malignant epithelial tumor.   Sections of the second specimen, labeled gastroesophageal junction,   shows squamous mucosa with reactive changes, including elongation of   papillae and basal zone excessive cell growth.  No eosinophils are seen.  No   glandular epithelium is present.  There is no evidence of abnormal cell growth or   malignant epithelial tumor.  Special stain is negative for fungal organisms and   intestinal mucin with adequate control.   Sections of the third specimen, labeled cecal tumor, shows   desmoplastic and fibrotic stroma infiltrated by irregular angulated   glands and acini composed of cells with enlarged hyperchromatic   irregular atypical round to oval nuclei.  Scattered glands show   luminal dirty tissue death.  The surface appears to be lined by   adenomatous epithelium.   Sections of the fourth specimen, labeled growth protruding from a mucous membrane at 45 cm, shows   growth protruding from a mucous membraneoid fragments of colonic mucosa with a tubular proliferation of   crypts lined by adenomatous epithelium.  There is no evidence of high   grade abnormal cell growth or malignant epithelial tumor.   DICTATION  DIAGNOSIS BY:\nTISSUE SUBMITTED:   1.  Duodenum tissue sampling   2.

        "doc_raw_text": "HISTORY: lung CA right upper lobe into right hilum\nICD9 CODES: 162.3, ,  FISH COMMENTS: Fluorescence localized tumor hybridization (FISH) analysis revealed a normal signal pattern in the cells analyzed.  No break-apart signal pattern, specific for ALK (2p23) rearrangements that occur in t(2;5) and variants, was detected.  However, it should be noted that the FISH probes utilized in this analysis cannot entirely exclude the presence of other chromosomal abnormalities.  Correlation with classic cytogenetics, clinical, flow cytometric, and morphological data is recommended, if available.  FISH analysis was performed in interphase cells using the Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase (ALK) dual color break-apart probe (**INSTITUTION., Des Plaines, IL). MOLEC COMMENTS: Table:  Exon 19 deletion, Increased responsiveness to TKIs, Deletions in exon 19 confer ligand independent activation and increase the duration and activation of receptor signaling after ligand binding. These deletions result in the modified receptors being approximately 100-fold more sensitive than wild-type receptors to inhibition with TKIs.  L858R, Increased responsiveness to TKIs, The missense mutation L858R confers ligand independent activation and increases the duration and activation of receptor signaling after ligand binding. This mutation results in the modified receptors being more sensitive than wild-type receptors to inhibition with TKIs.  G719S, G719A, G719C, Increased responsiveness to TKIs, Mutations at codon 719 in exon 19 are associated with response of NSCLC to gefitinib or erlotinib monotherapy, (slightly more than 50%)  although they are not as responsive as those with deletions in exon 19 or point mutations of codon 858 in exon 21.  S7681, Lack of responsiveness to TKI Mutations at codon 768 in exon 20 are associated with less responsiveness of NSCLC to gefitinib or erlontinib monotherapy.  L861Q, Increased responsiveness to TKIs, The missense mutation L861Q confers ligand independent activation and increases the duration and activation of receptor signaling after ligand binding. This mutation results in a modified receptor that has been reported to be more sensitive than wild-type receptor to inhibition with TKIs.  T790M, Lack of responsiveness to TKIs, T790M point mutation in exon 20 is a frequent cause of secondary resistance to TKIs. It appears that TKI administration may select for a pre-existing T790M resistance clone.  Exon 20 insertion, Lack of responsiveness to TKIs, Insertions in exon 20 have been associated with lack of clinical response of NSCLC to gefitinib or erlontinib monotherapy both in vitro and in patients despite the fact that they seem to activate EGFR to a similar degree as deletions in exon 19 or exon 21 mutations. This is a rare mutation however, and robust clinical data is lacking.  References: (1) **NAME[ZZZ, YYY M]. et al. N Engl J Med 350(21): 2129, 2004. (2) Wu, Jenn-Yu et al. Cl.n Cancer Res **ID-NUM, 2008. (3) Kobayashi, Susumu et al. N Engl J Med **ID-NUM, 2005.    Methodology:  Tumor areas of interest were identified and selectively microdissected from the paraffin-embedded tissue section. The collected cells were lysed, and the genomic DNA was purified from the sample. The DNA yield was determined, and the samples were brought to an optimal concentration. Real-time PCR was used to evaluate specific mutations, deletions and insertions in the tyrosine kinase domain of the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) gene. Eight reactions containing 30 primer and probe sets were used to target specific regions of exons 18-21 as well as the wild-type sequence.   Intended Use:  The EGFR mutation analysis by real-time PCR is able to detect the wild-type sequence and 29 known mutations, deletions and insertions found in exons 18-21 of the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain. The results of this study are to be interpreted in context with other clinical findings in patient care management. The intended use of this assay is to aid the treating physician in the selection of the appropriate therapy for the patient. There is a significant association between EGFR mutation, especially exon 19 deletion, and response to TKI's. This assay is capable of detecting a mutation of 1-5% in a background of wild-type alleles. These mutations are linked to clinical responsiveness to EGFR inhibitors, such as gefitinib (Iressa) and erlotinib (Tarceva).  * An \\\"Alteration Not Detected\\\" result does not preclude the presence of an EGFR mutation since results depend on percent mutant sequences, adequate specimen integrity, absence of inhibitors, and sufficient DNA to be detected.

FISH TECH DATA: nuc ish(ALKx2)[200] MICRO: Lung, right upper lobe bronchoscopic tissue sampling, confirms the clinical suspicion of malignant tumor.  This is squamous malignant epithelial tumor, moderately differentiated in a background of a mixed inflammatory cell population and mucus.  This is consistent with the tumor diathesis of invasion.  The tumor is moderately differentiated.  Molecular pathology, specifically the lung algorithm including EGFR mutation is in process and a supplemental report will follow.

The specimen is received in a Transpec container labeled with the patient's name, number, date and \"left breast.\"  The specimen is accompanied by a mammographic film and is found to contain a localization needle.  The film demonstrates a dense mass, fairly well-delineated lying adjacent to the midportion of the localization needle. The surgical surgical borders are inked beginning with the superior lateral and proceeding in a clockwise fashion with red, green, orange and black.  The deep margin is inked with purple.  The breast tissue is found to contain a 1.2 cm. firm glistening white-tan mass.  Grossly the mass lies approximately 1 cm. or more from all surgical borders except for the superior deep where it lies approximately 5 mm. or less from the inked surface.  The mass and this nearest margin are represented in Blocks A1 and 2.  The breast tissue shows evidence of blue dye discoloration consistent with tracer dye injection.  The nearest surgical borders from the anterior inferior lateral quadrant are placed in Block A3, the anterior superior lateral quadrant margin in Block A4, the anterior inferior medial quadrant in Block A5 and the anterior superior medial quadrant in Block A6. B.    The specimen is received in a container labeled with the patient's name, number, date and \"left axillary sentinel lymph node.\"  The specimen is received in formalin and consists of a portion of lobulated yellow-red tissue, measuring 3 x 1.5 x 1 cm.  The specimen is bisected revealing an encapsulated structure grossly consistent with lymph node.  The outer edge has a peripheral rim of tan-pink tissue while most of the tissue consists of adipose tissue consistent with fatty infiltrate.  No gross evidence of metastatic disease is identified.  The specimen is totally submitted in Block B. C.    The specimen is received in a container labeled with the patient's name, number, date and \"additional superior and deep margin left breast.\"  The specimen is received in formalin and consists of a lobulated portion of yellow adipose tissue, measuring 5.5 x 3.5 x 1 cm.  A surgical suture indicates the new margin.  The new margin is inked and the tissues are serially sectioned and are uniform lobulated yellow glistening throughout.  Multiple full thickness sections are placed in Blocks C1-4. Specimen A BREAST TISSUE WITH MASS GROSSLY CONSISTENT WITH GLANDULAR CANCER CLOSELY APPROXIMATING SUPERIOR DEEP QUADRANT MARGIN. REMAINING SURGICAL BORDERS WIDELY FREE OF TUMOR BY 1 CM. OR MORE. Specimen B LYMPH NODE, NO GROSS EVIDENCE OF METASTATIC MALIGNANT EPITHELIAL TUMOR IDENTIFIED.\nCOMMENT WORD: The left breast lumpectomy **ID-NUM (Specimen A) is found to contain a 1.2 cm. firm glistening white-tan mass.  Microscopically this mass is composed of atypical epithelial cells forming an infiltrating pattern of tubules surrounded by a desmoplastic reaction.  The cells are mildly pleomorphic and the mitotic rate is low.  No vascular infiltration by cancer is identified.  Grossly and microscopically, the neoplasm is noted to extend to within approximately 5 mm. of the superior deep margin.  The remaining surgical borders are widely free of tumor by 1 cm. or more.   The additional superior deep margin submitted as Specimen C shows no evidence of malignant epithelial tumor, therefore, all final surgical borders are felt to be widely free of tumor. There is no evidence of metastatic malignant epithelial tumor in the left axillary sentinel lymph node (Specimen B).  Staging criteria: T1c, N0 probable Stage IA.  Histopathologic grade: tubule formation 1, nuclear pleomorphism 2 and mitotic count 1 for a total score of 4 points, designated as a Grade I, G1 low tumor grade neoplasm.  Histopathologic type: infiltrating cancer ductal malignant epithelial tumor.  The breast tumor profile analysis will be performed and reported separately.\nSpecimen Number: ***PATH-NUMBER[2]. Tissues: A. Left breast - 10-12:00, Lumpectomy, Single stitch superior, double lateral B. Axillary lymph node - Left sentinel C. Left breast - Additional superior deep margin. Specimen Comments:\n"

Fluorescence in\n  situ hybridization for the Her-2/neu gene is then carried out using the FDA-\n  approved Vysis Path Vysion HER-2 DNA probe kit.  The prepared slides are then\n  viewed under a fluorescent microscope with appropriate filters for the\n  chromosome 17 probe (green), the Her-2/neu probe (orange) and DNA (blue) to\n  localize nuclei.  Signals are counted from up to 60 cells and the ratio of\n  Her-2/neu to chromosome 17 signals is computed.

Breast -Left breast core tissue sampling 12:00 / 5 cm from nipple \n<ADDENDUM> \nAddendum 1 Entered: **DATE[Feb 05 12]-0825 \nImmunohistochemical Studies Performed \nB. Left breast, 6:00, MRI-guided needle core tissue sampling: \nInvasive mammary malignant epithelial tumor with the following immunohistochemical features 1. \nEstrogen receptor expression: Positive (59% of cells, moderate staining \nintensity). \n2. Progesterone receptor expression: Positive (2% of cells, strong staining \nintensity). \n3. HER2 oncogene protein overexpression: Negative. \n\n \n<ADDENDUM> (Continued) \nIMMUNOHISTOCHEMICAL RESULTS \nDeparaffinized tissue sections undergo optimized epitope retrieval prior to incubation with \nthe appropriate antibody. Visualization is provided by an immunoperoxidase technique. \nImmunohistochemical staining is evaluated by visual examination of slides using a \nconventional light microscope and by computer-assisted morphometric analysis where noted. \nThe positive and negative control slides for each immunohistochemical test are reviewed and \nfound to exhibit the appropriate staining pattern. Results on the infiltrating cancer malignant epithelial tumor are as \nindicated in the table below \nTests performed on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded block: B1 \nAntibody (clone): Result \nEstrogen receptor (ER) (SP1): 59% *** \nProgesterone receptor (PR) (PgR 636): 2% *** \nHER2 (HerceptTest Dako) 1+ **** \n***Hormone receptor scoring is performed quantitatively by computer-assisted morphometric \nanalysis with an Applied Imaging Ariol system. Results are reported as positive for the \npercentage of neoplastic cells that exhibit the expected staining pattern when the \npercentage is greater than or equal to 1%. Results are reported as negative when the \npercentage of neoplastic cells that exhibit the expected staining pattern is less than 1%. \n****HER2 immunohistochemical slides are prepared with the Dako HercepTest (FDA method) \nfollowing the procedures as outlined in the test kit. Separate 1+, 2+, and 3+ staining \ncontrols are provided for each run. Analysis is performed by quantitative computer-assisted \nmorphometric analysis based on an appropriately trained Ariol (Applied Imaging) system. The \nimmunostained signal is analyzed for each selected area of the infiltrating cancer tumor. The final \nresults are scored according to CAP-ASCO HER2 testing guidelines (Wolff et al., 2007) as \nnegative (either 0 or 1+), equivocal (2+, requiring a calculated signal of at least 2+ in \n>10% of the selected tumor), or positive (3+, requiring a calculated signal of 3+ in >30% of \nthe selected tumor). Validation studies are performed on a set of tumors for which \nimmunohistochemical and fluorescence localized tumor hybridization (FISH) results are known from \noutside studies performed by an external laboratory using validated methods. The validation \nset consists of 97 immunohistochemical results (which includes 33 external 3+ scores and 35 \nexternal negative scores) and 49 FISH results (which consists of 16 positive results and 33 \nnegative results). Comparison of the internal immunohistochemical scores obtained by \ncomputer-assisted morphometric analysis with the external immunohistochemical scores reveals \nno discordance between immunohistochemical internal (negative, 3+) scores and external (3+, \nnegative) scores, respectively. Specifically, identical results are found with all 33 of the \nexternally scored 3+ cases and with 34 of the 35 externally scored negative cases, with one \nof the externally scored negative cases given an internal score of 2+ (equivocal). Cases \npossessing internal scores of negative or 3+ but which are externally scored as 2+ are found \nto possess negative and positive FISH results which are 100% concordant with the internal \nnegative and 3+ immunohistochemical scores, respectively. Comparison of the internal \nimmunohistochemical scores obtained by computer-assisted morphometric analysis with the \nexternal FISH scores reveals no discordance between immunohistochemical (negative, 3+) \nscores and FISH results. Specifically, all 22 internal negative immunohistochemical scores \ncorrespond to negative FISH results and all 14 internal 3+ immunohistochemical scores \ncorrespond to positive FISH results. The remaining 13 FISH results correspond to internal 2+ \nimmunohistochemical scores. \n\n \n<ADDENDUM> (Continued) \nBreast specimens are allowed to fix in 10% neutral buffered formalin for at least 6 hours \nand complete processing within 36 hours of receipt unless otherwise noted. \nThis laboratory participates in external HER2 proficiency testing as specified in the \nCAP-ASCO HER2 testing guidelines (Wolff et al., 2007). \nThe performance characteristics of these immunohistochemical tests have been determined by \n**INSTITUTION.

PATHOLOGIST's COMMENTS  Reviewed for QA (GK). \nGROSS DESCRIPTION  Received fresh designated \"TAH, BSO, abdominal perineal resection\" are two separate specimens in the container; first is a uterus with cervix and bilateral fallopian tubes and ovaries weighing 300 grams.  Also received is an **DATE[Mar] specimen including colon, rectum and anus.  Attached vagina is present anteriorly.  Dr. **NAME[UUU] demonstrated the connection between the two specimens and the anterior portion of the uterus is inked blue for orientation.  The segment of bowel, including anus, measures 45 cm in length.  The proximal portion consists of colon and is closed with a staple line.  The distal end is anus consisting of skin closed with a suture.  The distal portion of the specimen is retroperitoneal. Anteriorly, located 9.0 cm from the distal margin is a 5.2 x 5.2 cm diamond shaped area of attached vagina with staple lines.  It has been somewhat torn but appears to entirely cover the underlying rectum and tumor.  A palpable mass is identified beginning approximately 8 cm from the distal margin with possible thickening of the distal rectal portion for a length of approximately 2.0 cm beginning 3 cm from the anal margin.  The specimen is placed in formalin for fixation and further dictation.  Following fixation, the specimen is re-examined.  The fixed abdominal perineal resection specimen including anus, rectum and sigmoid colon in the fixed state measures 38.0 cm.  The distal 11.4 cm consist of lower rectum and anus which is totally non-peritonealized.  Near the lower end of the peritoneal reflection 12.0 cm from the distal margin, the peritoneum has been torn for a length of 3.5 cm.  As previously described, the anterior rectum is partially covered by an irregular roughly diamond shaped of piece of vagina.  The upper portion of this piece of vaginal wall is torn and contains sutures.  Posteriorly, the peritoneal reflection is identified and the distal 18.0 cm posteriorly are retroperitoneal. The mesorectum is identified posteriorly 7.0 cm from the distal margin of resection and appears intact.  The surgical borders are inked as follows:  anterior deep margin with vaginal mucosa - black; corresponding lower uterine segment and cervix - black; proximal peritoneum - blue; distal adventitia including mesorectum - green. The specimen is opened and the squamocolumnar   junction is 3 cm from the distal margin. The tumor measures 5.5 x 5.0 x 2.4 cm.  It is pink-red and firm, has an irregular shape and it is entirely circumferential in the rectum. It is grossly located above the squamocolumnar junction.  It grossly extends through muscle wall, and possibly to the deep margin.  The distal margin is located 5.5 cm from the tumor. The proximal margin is 25.5 cm from the tumor.  The peritoneal margin is 7.0 cm from the tumor.  Proximal to the squamocolumnar junction the rectal mucosa appears somewhat redundant.

They are submitted as follows: 39.        four small nodes 40.        four small nodes 41.        bisected nodes 42.        one node 43.        one sectioned node 44.        two nodes 45\\T\\46.        largest node sectioned  Received is a round detached uterus with a smooth shiny serosa with a few adhesions.  The uterus measures 9.0 x 7.5 x 5.5 cm.  The cervix is unremarkable and measures 3.5 x 3.0 cm.   It has a 0.3 cm slit-like os.  The os is slightly stenotic.  The ovaries and fallopian tubes are attached.  The uterus is opened to reveal a tan, triangular endometrium measuring 3.5 x 5.0 cm with a maximum endometrial thickness of 0.2 cm.  The myometrium is sectioned and has a maximum thickness of 4.3 cm.  The endocervical canal is unremarkable.  The right ovary and fallopian tube weigh 12.0 grams.  The ovary has a dusky, gray-purple appearance and multiple serosal fluid-filled sacs ranging in size from 0.5 to 1.3 cm in greatest dimension.  They all contain clear fluid and smooth shiny walls.  The ovary measures 2.0 x 2.0 x 1.5 cm.  It is sectioned and the cut surfaces are unremarkable.  The attached fimbriated fallopian tube measures 6.0 cm in length with a diameter ranging in size from 0.5 to 0.7 cm.  The left ovary weighs 18.0 grams.  The ovary has a dusky, purple-blue appearance and measures 1.6 x 1.4 x 1.0 cm.  The ovary is sectioned and the cut surfaces reveal two fluid-filled sacic areas and possible corpora lutea.  The smaller measures 1.3 cm in diameter and the larger measures 1.5 cm in diameter.  The attached fimbriated fallopian tube measures 5.0 cm in length with a diameter ranging in size from 0.4 up to 0.6 cm.

Further sectioning reveals tumor located at the squamocolumnar junction, 3.0 cm from the distal proximal margin.  There is also a possible 5 mm tan-white tumor small lump identified along one cauterized edge of the specimen.  Violet ink is placed on the cauterized surface for identification.  The remaining anus is identified.

ADDITIONALLY, THERE IS A HYPERPLASTIC GROWTH PROTRUDING FROM A MUCOUS MEMBRANE.  PATHOLOGIST's COMMENTS  IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY REPORT  Using appropriate positive and negative controls, sections from the rectal growth protruding from a mucous membranes specimen are submitted for immunoreactive synaptophysin, chromogranin, and CD56 via an immunohistochemical technique.  Tumor cells stain strongly and diffusely positive for synaptophysin and moderately and diffusely positive for CD56.  Tumor cells are negative for chromogranin.  All internal and external controls react appropriately.  INTERPRETATION:  This staining pattern is supportive of a carcinoid tumor.

Sections of the growth protruding from a mucous membrane at lower left colon show multiple fragments of growth protruding from a mucous membraneoid material with tubular adenomatous variety of architecture with some villous transformation appreciated, mild to moderate.  Congestion is present in the stroma. Inflammation is chronic.   No malignant features are seen.  No localized tumor and no infiltrating cancer change is identified. Deeper sections show similar features. Sections of the growth protruding from a mucous membrane at rectum show a tubular adenoma with medium-grade abnormal cell growth.  No localized tumor and no infiltrating cancer change is seen. Some focal areas of mild to moderate abnormal cell growth are present on the surface of this growth protruding from a mucous membraneoid structure.  No localized tumor and no infiltrating cancer malignant epithelial tumor is seen.  Deeper sections show fragments with superficial severe abnormal cell growth.  Carcinoma localized tumor in this fragment of growth protruding from a mucous membraneoid tissue from the rectum is present.  These are one the small fragments near the superficial layer of the mucosa.  Hyperchromatism and irregular nuclear membranes are present with mitotic activity.  No infiltrating cancer features are identified. <Sign Out Dr. **NAME[ZZZ]> **NAME[YYY XXX], M.D, PATHOLOGIST Page 1 of 1\nTISSUE SUBMITTED:  (1) GROWTH PROTRUDING FROM A MUCOUS MEMBRANE, SURGICAL EXCISION Left colon growth protruding from a mucous membranes (2) GROWTH PROTRUDING FROM A MUCOUS MEMBRANE, SURGICAL EXCISION Polyp @ lower left colon (3) GROWTH PROTRUDING FROM A MUCOUS MEMBRANE, SURGICAL EXCISION Polyp @ rectum\n"

At 9:00, there are two foci of infiltrating cancer tumor in a single section\nseparated by tissue sampling-related changes. The greatest overall dimension is 1.8\ncm on a glass slide. Per Dr. **NAME[ZZZ YYY], on MRI there was a clumped\nlesion at 9-10 o'clock, 6.6 to 8 cm from the nipple, and biopsies were\ntaken on either side of the lesion. Given these findings and the histologic\nfindings, a tumor stage of T1c is assigned. The tissue surrounding the\nretroareolar tissue sampling demonstrates atypical lobular excessive cell growth without\ninfiltrating cancer tumor.\nGROSS DESCRIPTION:  Number of specimen containers: 2.  Labeled with name\nand date of birth:  **NAME[BBB, AAA] and **DATE[Dec 20 1960].\nA.   Container designation: \"right breast\" --  Received fresh is a 752\ngrams, 20.7 cm medial to lateral x 14.7 cm superior to inferior x 5.3 cm\nanterior to posterior right breast which is oriented as per requisition\nslip as follows:  clip in axilla.  The breast is surfaced by a 5.3 cm\ndiameter portion of skin which contains an unremarkable nipple and areola.\nThe surgical borders are inked as follows:  superior superficial   blue, inferior\nsuperficial   green, and deep   black.  At the 9:00 position 7.5 cm from\nthe nipple is a 3.0 x 2.5 x 2.2 cm ill-defined apparent tissue sampling cavity with\nareas of focally chalky yellow apparent fat tissue death and no gross evidence\nof tumor.  The apparent tissue sampling cavity comes within 1.2 cm of the\nsuperficial margin and 2.0 cm of the deep margin and has an embedded\nintraparenchymal clip.  There is a second lesion at the 12:00 position in\nthe retroareolar region which consists of a 1.8 x 1.5 x 1.3 cm area of\nnodularity with no gross evidence of tumor.  The nodularity comes within\n2.0 cm of the superficial margin and 4.3 cm of the deep margin and has an\nintraparenchymal clip.  Elsewhere, the cut surfaces have approximately 10%\nfocally blue-dyed fibrous stroma with no additional abnormality.\nCassettes:  representative A1 nipple; A2-A5 tissue sampling cavity at 8:00 position;\nA6 deep margin underlying tissue sampling cavity; A7-A10 nodularity at 1:00\nposition; A11 surgical borders at 1:00 nodularity; A12 upper inner quadrant; A13\nlower inner quadrant; A14 lower outer quadrant; A15 upper outer quadrant.\n(upper outer quadrant 7 cm from the nipple and 5 cm from skin edge, lower\ninner quadrant 4:30 position 7 cm from the nipple and 5 cm from the skin\nedge, lower outer quadrant 6:30 position 7 cm from the nipple and 5.2 cm\nfrom the skin edge, upper outer quadrant 9.0 cm from the nipple and 6.5 cm\nfrom the skin edge).\nINTRAOPERATIVE CONSULTATION   RIGHT BREAST   LESION WITH CLIP IDENTIFIED,\n1.2 cm FROM CLOSEST (ANTERIOR) MARGIN (GROSS ONLY) (XX).\nB.   Container Received fresh is a 4 x 2.5 x 0.5 cm portion of fat which\ncontains six lymph nodes ranging from 0.5 to 1.2 cm in greatest dimension.\nTwo of the lymph nodes are blue-dyed.  A scrape prep of each lymph node is\nobtained on four slides.  The lymph nodes are entirely submitted two per\ncassette with one inked in B1-B3. INTRAOPERATIVE CYTOLOGY DIAGNOSIS   RIGHT\nSENTINEL LYMPH NODES   SIX NODES, NEGATIVE ON SCRAPE PREP (XX).\nC.   Container designation: \"deep margin right breast\" --  The specimen\nconsists of a 3.1 x 1.7 x 0.7 cm breast tissue sampling which is oriented as per\nrequisition slip as follows:  clip right breast towards tumor.  The outer\nsurface is inked as follows:  aspect with clip   blue and remaining outer\nsurface   black.  The cut surfaces are comprised of greater than 95%\nadipose tissue and less than 5% fibrous stroma with no gross abnormality.\nCassettes:  entirely C1-C2.\nD.   Container designation: \"lateral/anterior margin\" --  The specimen\nconsists of a 3.3 x 2.5 x 1.2 cm breast tissue sampling which is oriented as per\nrequisition slip as follows:  clip towards tumor.  The outer surfaces are\ninked as follows:  aspect with clip   blue and remaining outer surface\nblack.

The bilateral vas averages 3.5cm in length and bilateral seminal vesicles average 2.0 x 1.5 x 1.0cm.  The prostate gland is inked as follows:  right lobe  blue, left lobe  black.  The proximal and distal urethral resection surgical borders are taken en face and submitted in their entirety.  The prostate gland is sectioned from the distal toward the proximal aspect to reveal tan, glistening, prostatic parenchyma with numerous tan small lumps which bulge from the cut surface.  The small lumps are in both the right and left lobes and compress the surrounding probe patent urethra.  No single discrete area of tumor is grossly identified.  Representative sections are submitted.  Summary of Sections: A  right vas margin, B  left vas margin, C  distal urethra, D  proximal urethra, E-T  right lobe of prostate submitted every other slice sequentially from the distal toward the proximal aspect, U-JJ  left lobe of prostate submitted every other slice sequentially from the distal toward the proximal aspect.  **INITIALS\nMicroscopic Description The right and left vas surgical borders and the distal and proximal urethra surgical borders are free of tumor.  Multiple sections from the right lobe show involvement with glandular cancer.  The tumor shows infiltrating glands with large hyperchromatic nuclei with some gland fusion.  The tumor infiltrates into the prostatic capsule with focal extraprostatic extension on the right side, but no marginal involvement is seen.  The tumor involves approximately 15% of the right lobe.  The left lobe shows similar tumor involvement with infiltrating glands with some gland fusion.  No extraprostatic extension or marginal involvement is identified on this side.

No overlying skin is identified.  The specimen is received oriented as follows:  \"Short suture superior, long lateral, opening is anterior.\"  The specimen measures 9.7 cm from right lateral to medial pole, 8.5 cm from inferior to superior edge and 6.0 cm from anterior to deep/posterior.  A thick and firm segment of brown-red muscle at the deep margin measures 4.6 x 3.2 x 0.9 cm.  A large and central fenestration on the anterior surface exposes an underlying seroma cavity with a reconstructed measurement of 5.0 x 4.5 x 3.5 cm.  Again, no skin is grossly identified.  The fenestration measures 3.5 x 3.0 cm.  The deep margin is black inked, the anterior rim surrounding the aforementioned fenestration is yellow inked, superior blue, inferior red, medial orange and lateral green.  The specimen is serially sectioned perpendicular to the long axis/transverse plane.\nAt its closest approach the seroma cavity is exposed at the central anterior surface, as previously described.  At its closest approach the seroma cavity is 0.5 cm from the black inked central deep/posterior, 1.8 cm from the red inked inferior, 1.5 cm from the green inked lateral, 0.7 cm from the blue inked superior and 0.7 cm from the orange inked medial.  Immediately adjacent to the seroma cavity has focal firm fat tissue death.  No infiltrating cancer lesion or calcifications are grossly identified.  Representative sequential sections are submitted in 14 cassettes.\nSummary of sections:  1A - seroma cavity with blue inked superior at double short suture; 1B - anterolateral approximately 0.5 cm from  the superior pole; 1C-1D - anteromedial approximately 1.0 cm from the superior pole; 1E - deep/posterior approximately 1.5 cm from superior pole; 1F - orange inked medial approximately 1.5 cm from superior pole; 1G - deep/posterior approximately 2.0 cm from superior pole; 1I - lateral approximately 3.0 cm from superior pole; 1J - anteromedial approximately 3.0 cm from superior pole; 1K - deep/posterior approximately 4.0 cm from superior pole; 1L - anterior approximately 5.0 cm from superior pole; 1M - inferolateral approximately 1.0 cm from inferior pole; 1N - red inked inferior pole.  (**INITIALS **DATE[Jan 7 12])\n\n\n<MICROSCOPIC>\nIn all of the sections except one the changes are non-cancerous.  In 1K representing a deep margin section approximately 4 cm from the superior pole there is a small focus of residual infiltrating cancer malignant tumor.  This is a small focus of infiltrating nests of tumor cells that are small polygonal cells not forming tubules but having only intermediate sized nuclei without significant mitotic activity.  They do not invade vascular spaces.  They do not extend to the deep margin at that point.  Elsewhere post tissue sampling changes are present extensively.  In 1G skeletal muscle is present at the deep margin but not where the tumor was in 1K.  In 1E there is a small fibroadenoma.  No other malignant tumor is evident.\n1K-1: Residual infiltrating cancer malignant epithelial tumor\nR.

The second part received labeled right lower paratracheal lymph nodes contains multiple variably sized fragments of dark brown anthracotic lymph node and associated yellow adipose tissue measuring approximately 2.2 cm in aggregate.  The specimens are entirely frozen as one block. FROZEN SECTION DIAGNOSIS:  Unremarkable lymph nodes and associated fibroadipose tissue perinodal soft tissue; negative for malignant tumor.      (BEW) The frozen material is entirely submitted as B1. The third part received labeled lymph node of right pulmonary artery adjacent to right upper lobe bronchus are multiple fragments of red and tan tissue that are 3-8 mm and are entirely submitted as C1. The fourth part received labeled right upper lobe bronchus is a 1.4 cm fragment of red and tan tissue which is entirely submitted as D1. The fifth part received labeled azygous node are three fragments of red and tan tissue that are 9 mm up to 1.5 cm. The larger fragments are bisected revealing two lymph nodes that are 4 and 5 mm. The specimen is entirely submitted as E1. The sixth part received labeled additional right upper lobe is a 1.1 cm piece of red and tan tissue which is bisected and entirely submitted as F1. The seventh part received labeled right middle lobe are three fragments of red and tan tissue that are 5 mm up to 1.5 cm. The specimens are bisected and entirely submitted as G1. The eighth part received labeled upper bronchus nerve is a 1.5 cm fragment of red and tan tissue which is bisected and entirely submitted as H1. The ninth part received labeled middle lobe node are two fragments of red and tan tissue that are 5 and 7 mm which are each bisected and entirely submitted as I1. The tenth part received labeled right upper lobe is a 143 gram 11.9 x 8.4 x 4.4 cm lobectomy specimen. The pleura is pink and tan. Of note is an area of pleural retraction that is 2.5 cm. This area is marked with ink and the specimen is sectioned revealing a 2.9 cm firm necrotic tan neoplasm which is in direct association with the area of pleural retraction and comes to within 1 mm of the pleural surface. The lesion also comes to within 1.5 cm of the bronchial margin. The remainder of the specimen is unremarkable. There are no grossly identifiable parabronchial lymph nodes. Representative sections of bronchial margin are submitted as J1, lesion and inked pleural surface J2, 3 and 4, and random sections through the remainder of the specimen as J5 The eleventh part received labeled pericardial sac from right atrium off superior vena cava atrial junction is a 2.6 x 2 x 0.3 cm fragment of pink and tan tissue. Representative sections are submitted as K1. (LDA) IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY REPORT Using formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissue with the appropriate positive and negative controls, the specimens designated right lower paratracheal nodes, lymph node right pulmonary artery adjacent to right upper lobe bronchus, right upper lobe bronchus, azygous node, lymph node adjacent to right upper lobe, lymph node right middle lobe, upper bronchus tissue sampling, right middle lobe node (blocks B1, C1, D1, E1, F1, G1, H1, I1) are stained for immunoreactive pankeratin using an automated immunohistochemical technique.  The examined preparations are interpreted as negative; all external controls react appropriately. INTERPRETATION:  Unremarkable lymph nodes and associated perinodal soft tissue without light microscopic and/or immunohistochemical evidence of metastatic squamous cell malignant epithelial tumor.

Container designation: \"right hemi-colon\" --  Received unopened in\nminimal formalin is a contiguous segment of terminal ileum, cecum, and\nascending and portion of transverse colon 30 cm in total length.  The\nterminal ileum measures 7 cm in length.  The proximal and distal bowel\nsurgical borders are approximated by wire sutures and measure 2.5 and 3.0 cm in\nexternal diameter respectively.  The serosa is pink, tan to dusky-gray with\nan area of puckering, 1.5 cm in diameter grossly approaching within 9.0 cm\nof the nearest (distal) resection margin.  This area is inked.  The\nappendix is identified, 4.5 cm in length, 0.7 cm in external diameter and\nopening demonstrates a lumen occupied by loosely formed gray fecal\nmaterial.  The bowel is opened demonstrating a lumen entirely occupied by\nloosely formed green fecal material.  The bowel is remarkable for a\ncircumferential, annular, pink, tan centrally ulcerated mass 3.8 x 2.6 x\n1.4 cm corresponding to the aforementioned area of serosal puckering,\ngrossly approaching within 7.5 cm of the nearest (distal) resection margin.\nSectioning through the mass demonstrates yellow-gray gritty cut surfaces\nwith gross extension through the muscularis grossly approaching within 0.1\ncm of the inked radial margin.  The mucosa of the terminal ileum, cecum,\nand ascending (proximal to the tumor) demonstrates an attenuated dusky-gray\nappearance and the wall ranges from 0.1 to 0.5 cm in thickness.  The mucosa\ndistal to the tumor demonstrates a pink, tan glistening appearance with its\nnormal transverse folds.  No other lesions are grossly identified.\nCassette summary:  A1 representative proximal and distal bowel surgical borders of\nresection.

IHC/a/THM,CLS MER/ap  Electronically Signed Out By **NAME[XXX], M.D.,  MARK E.\nGross Description Received in formalin labeled \"sigmoid colon\" is a 23-cm-long unopened segment of large intestine, having both surgical borders closed with metal sutures and including a moderate amount of partially shredded pericolonic fat.  Located 4.5 cm from one sutured margin, there is a puckered and firm area seen on the serosa.  This area is marked with ink for later identification.  When opened, the specimen is found to contain a metallic mesh stent which begins at the sutured margin near the area of serosal dimpling and extends 10 cm up the lumen from that margin.  The lumen remains patent although the area closest to the margin (in the area of the serosal dimpling) is narrowed to 1.5 cm in diameter.  This is in comparison to an average diameter of 3 cm.  The area of the metallic stent is covered by mucoid material.  Beginning 1.5 cm from the sutured margin associated with the stent, there is a 3.5 x 2.5 x 1.7 cm circumferential area of ulcerated firm tan tissue.  This is suggestive of a neoplasm.  Proximal and distal to the lesion, the mucosa is granular and hyperemic.  This lesional area involves the pericolonic fat and is 3.5 cm from the closest irregular mesenteric soft tissue margin.  The bowel away from the area with the stent shows a few diverticula.  No other mass lesions are seen.  The attached fat is found to contain multiple firm pink tan to gray tan lymph node candidates to 0.8 cm in greatest dimension.  A few of these appear grossly abnormal.  Sections are submitted as follows:  SUMMARY OF SECTIONS: A:  Shave adjacent to sutured margin closest to lesion.  B, C:  Area of serosal dimpling. D through G:  Additional sections through lesional area. H, I:  Additional sections of bowel beneath stent. J:  Representative diverticula. K:  Shave adjacent to sutured margin furthest from lesion. L:  Mesenteric soft tissue margin closest to lesion. M through P:  Intact mesenteric lymph node candidates. NOTE:  A request for a photograph of this specimen has been made by the surgeon.  The pathology department does not have a camera.  The surgery department has been contacted and we have been informed that at present, there is nobody that routinely takes specimen photographs.  The specimen is therefore processed in the usual manner without photography.   LW/USO/MER/ap\nMicroscopic Description Incorporated in diagnosis.

Filling the cecum and involving the ileocecal valve, there is a 10.7 x 9.3 x up to 5.3 cm firm tan neoplastic-appearing lesion, having raised friable and granular edges and a firm central portion.  Within this firm central portion, there is an irregular 4.3 x 4.0 cm full-thickness defect in the bowel wall.  The serosa adjacent to the defect is granular and this area is marked with India ink.  The adjacent appendix is 5.5 cm in length, 0.7cm in diameter.  This appears uninvolved.  The lesion is 5.5 cm from the partially shredded disrupted mesenteric apex margin.  This margin appears uninvolved by tumor.  The bowel distal to the lesion shows two submucosal small lumps of fat which are 1.1 and 1.4 cm in greatest dimension.  These are located 8.5 and 15.7 cm from the unremarkable appearing distal bowel margin.  No other bowel lesions are seen.  The attached fat is found to contain multiple grossly non-cancerous pink tan lymph nodes to 1.7 cm in greatest dimension.  Detached but within the same container is a 6.3 x 2.1 x 1.5 cm irregular piece of intestinal tissue, distorted by black silk and metal sutures.  This shows no lesions.  Sections are submitted as follows:  A:  A shave adjacent to each sutured bowel margin. B:  Ileocecal valve including tumor involvement. C though E:  Tumor with ink on edges of defect. F, G:  Additional representative sections of lesion. H:  Appendix. I, J:  Submucosal masses of fat. K:  Mesenteric apex soft tissue margin. L:  One serially sectioned mesenteric lymph node. M:  One serially sectioned lymph node. N:  One serially sectioned lymph node. O:  One serially sectioned lymph node. P:  One serially sectioned lymph node. Q through U:  Intact mesenteric lymph node candidates. V:  Representative sections, detached piece of intestine. **INITIALS\nMicroscopic Description Incorporated in diagnosis.\n"

In addition, there is dim, partial expression for T-cell markers CD4 and CD7.  There is no significant expression for CD33, myeloperoxidase, or other surface or cytoplasmic antigens associated with T or B-lineage differentiation.  The immunophenotypic findings are consistent with a blast population of myeloid lineage.  \n\nThis test has not been cleared or approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, but the FDA does not require this test to go through premarket FDA review.  **INSTITUTION Pathology Laboratory, which is regulated under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA) as qualified to perform high complexity clinical testing, has developed this test's performance characteristics.  This test should be used for clinical purposes and should not be regarded as investigational or research.\n\nAML FISH PANEL:  NORMAL.\n\nInterphase FISH analysis of at least 200 interphase nuclei per probe was performed with AML specific probe set (**PLACE, IL) to detect abnormalities commonly associated with acute myeloid blood cancer. All FISH signals from all probe sets were within the normal reference range. This represents a NORMAL result indicating the absence of deletion or monosomy of chromosomes 5 and 7; the absence of\ntrisomy for chromosome 8 (i.e., +8), and the absence of any gene rearrangements or translocations involving 11q23, t(8;21), t(15;17), and inv(16).\nResultsComments:\nSee NeoGenomics Laboratories report for additional information.\n"

SPECIMEN SUBMITTED NAME: 1. BAL FLUID, RIGHT UPPER LOBE:  Atypical. 2. BRONCHIAL BRUSHING, RIGHT UPPER LOBE:  Malignant.\nGROSS DESCRIPTION Specimen one is received for frozen section diagnosis labeled \\\"mediastinal mass\\\" and consist of a 0.5 cm thin disc of red soft tissue.  The entire cluster is submitted for frozen section.  The frozen section portion is all of the tissue received and is submitted in one cassette labeled 1FS-1. Specimen two is labeled \\\"right upper lobe tissue sampling\\\" and consists of minute fragments of tiny tan tissue measuring 0.1 to 0.2 cm.  The total cluster measures 0.3 cm. All are submitted in one cassette labeled 2. Specimen three is labeled \\\"right mediastinal lymph node\\\" and consists of two tan-red nodes measuring 0.3 and 0.4 cm.  Both are submitted in one cassette labeled 3. Specimen four is labeled \\\"mediastinal mass\\\" and consists of a red-tan fragment of tissue measuring 0.4 cm and another measuring 0.3 cm and some black tissue measuring 0.1 x 0.3 cm.  All tissue is submitted in one cassette labeled 4.\nMICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION Review of the mediastinal mass, 1FS-1, show a metastatic tumor of epithelial origin, large-cell, non-keratinizing lesion present in bundles and clusters scattered throughout the entire mass submitted for frozen section.  After H\\T\\E staining, sections of the mediastinal mass, 1FS-1, show malignant epithelial tumor in small lumps and clusters within the frozen section portion.  Diffuse involvement of the mediastinal tissue by this tumor is noted.  Permanent section of the frozen section portion shows a malignant metastatic tumor, large-cell epithelial variety, non-keratinizing tumor present. Sections of the right upper lobe lung tissue sampling, 2A-1, show alveolar tissue, dense septal walls and a cellular infiltrate of cells having features compatible with large-cell squamous malignant epithelial tumor with inflammation present.  Desmoplastic response and cells are free within the alveolar spaces.  The cells have large oval nuclei and prominent nucleoli with dense clumped chromatin.  Inflammation is also present. Sections of the right mediastinal lymph node, 3A-1, show more of the mediastinal lymph node architecture with diffuse excessive cell growth in the residual fragments.  A nodular proliferation is noted.  The lymph node structure is sectioned serially and three levels are identified in this one block and is sectioned and no tumor is seen. Sections of the mediastinal mass, 4A-1, show metastatic large-cell, keratinizing, squamous malignant epithelial tumor with irregular clusters and bundles streaming through the mediastinal mass.  Mitotic activity is plentiful. Individual cell keratinization is seen in small cells with keratin production present.  Deeper sections of the mediastinal mass show large cell malignant epithelial tumor scattered throughout with individual cell keratinization.  Keratin pearl formation is present.  Dense pink cytoplasm is present in multiple clusters of this tumor.\nTISSUE SUBMITTED:  (1) MASS, SURGICAL EXCISION Mediastinal mass (2) LUNG, TISSUE SAMPLING, SURGICAL EXCISION Right upper lobe tissue sampling (3) LYMPH NODES, SURGICAL EXCISION Mediastinal lymph node (4) MASS, SURGICAL EXCISION Mediastinal mass\n"

Labeled with name\nand date of birth:  **NAME[BBB, AAA] and **DATE[Mar 09 1962].\nA.   Container designation: \"Meckel's\"   The specimen consists of a 3.0 x\n2.5 x 1.5 cm portion of small bowel with a stapled end and contains (2.7 cm\nfrom stapled end) two pedunculated pouch-like extensions measuring 1.3 x\n1.1 x 1.1 cm and 1.1 x 1.0 x 1.1 cm.  The serosa is diffusely dull and\ncontains focal exudate.  The stapled margin is inked black.  The cut\nsurfaces are unremarkable and both growth protruding from a mucous membraneoid pouch-like extension appears to\nhave three layers and resembles a true diverticulum.  Cassettes:  A1-A2\nboth pouch-like extension.\nB.   Container designation: \"rectum plus sigmoid colon\"   Received fresh\nfor intraoperative consultation is a 16.1 cm designated (stitch proximal\nend per the requisition slip) portion of large bowel with an open and\nstapled ends.  There is a suture on the soft tissue subjacent to the\nstapled end.  The circumference of the bowel ranges from 4.2 cm to 1.0 cm\n(constricted).  The serosa is focally dull and partially disrupted at the\nconstricted site and contains moderate amount of attached fat.  The serosa\nand the closest soft tissue margin at the constricted site is inked black.\nAt the constrictive site within the mucosa there is a 4.0 x 3.5 x 2.5 cm\ncircumferential cavitated thickened mass which is approximately 3.6 cm from\ndistal margin, greater than 5 cm from proximal margin and 5.1 cm from\nproximal soft tissue margin.  The cut surfaces reveal the mass is extending\nthrough the serosa and soft tissue, and may involve the distal and the\nclosest soft tissue margin.  The remaining mucosa does not reveal any\ngrowth protruding from a mucous membranes, diverticula, or any additional masses.  Sectioning through the\nattached fat reveals multiple possible lymph nodes up to 0.5 cm.\nCassettes:  B1   proximal margin (inked blue); B2   distal margin; B3\nclosest soft tissue margin; B4-B9   mass (B4-B5   mass and normal mucosa\ntowards distal end); B10-B11   normal mucosa (B10   normal mucosa adjacent\nto the mass towards proximal end); B12   four possible lymph nodes (one\nbisected and inked red); B13   multiple entire possible lymph nodes; B14\nmultiple entire possible lymph nodes; B15   one possible lymph node.\nINTRAOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS   RECTUM AND SIGMOID COLON:  4 cm GROSSLY CLEAR\nMARGIN DISTALLY.  (XX).\nC.   Container designation: \"small bowel\"   The specimen consists of an\nunoriented, 5.0 cm portion of small bowel with two stapled ends.  The\nserosa appears diffusely dull and contains a small amount of attached fat.\nThe two ends are inked black and blue for differentiation.  The\ncircumference of the specimen averages 3.6 cm and approximately 45% of\nmucosal surface appears erythematous. However, the cut surface does not\nreveal any growth protruding from a mucous membranes, ulcerations, or masses.  Sectioning through the fat\nreveals one conspicuous lymph node (1.0 cm).  Representative tissue - C1-C4\n(C1   margin); C5   lymph node.\nD.   Container designation: \"donut colonic\"   The specimen consists of a\n3.0 x 1.5 x 0.6 cm annular shaped portion of bowel tissue with multiple\nstaples and a suture and is attached to a metallic device.  The specimen is\ninked entirely black and the cut surfaces are unremarkable.  Cassettes:\nsubmitted entirely in D1.\nE.   Container designation: \"rectal donut\"   The specimen consists of a 1.5\nx 1.5 x 0.6 cm annular shaped portion of bowel with staples and is attached\nto a metallic device.

Pathway Anti-HER2 rabbit monoclonal\nantibody, clone 4B5) are carried out on formalin-fixed,\nparaffin-embedded tissue sections.  Positive and negative controls show\nappropriate reactivity. Interpretation of Ventana Pathway for HER2\nimmunostain is performed according to guidelines recommended by ASCO/CAP\nin 2007 (see comment below).  Results are as follows:\nBlock A1\n\nAntibody  Result    Comment\nHER2 0    Negative for overexpression\n\nImpression:\nInterpreted by:  **NAME[VVV M UUU] M.D.\nComment:\n\n1.  The guideline recommendations by ASCO/CAP in 2007 is as follows:  A\nscore of 3+ (positive HER2 test) is defined by uniform intense membrane\nstaining in >30% of tumor cells.  A score of 2+ (equivocal HER2 test) is\ndefined by complete membrane staining that is either nonuniform or weak\nin intensity but with obvious circumferential distribution in at least\n10% of tumor cells, or less commonly, intense complete membrane staining\nbut in only 30% or fewer tumor cells.  A score of 0 or 1+ (negative HER2\ntest) is defined by no or weak and incomplete membrane staining in any\nproportion of tumor cells.\n2.  The correlation between HER2 protein overexpression by\nimmunohistochemistry and HER2/neu gene amplification by fluorescence in\nsitu hybridization (FISH) is not 100%.  Rare cases interpreted as\nnegative (0 and 1+) for HER2 protein overexpression may demonstrate low\nlevel HER2/neu gene amplification by FISH.  Approximately 10-20% of\ncases interpreted as 2+ may show gene amplification by FISH, while the\nvast majority of cases, if not all, interpreted as 3+ show gene\namplification by FISH.  Therefore, additional testing for HER2/neu gene\namplification by fluorescence localized tumor hybridization (FISH) may be\nconsidered on individual cases, if clinically warranted.  Reflexive\ntesting for HER2/neu gene amplification by FISH will be performed on all\ncases interpreted as 2+ (equivocal for protein overexpression) by\nimmunohistochemistry.

ANCILLARY STUDIES (Processed at P\\T\\C Laboratories and reviewed by Dr. **NAME[TTT M. SSS]) CYTOLOGY RESULTS (11-PM-821 / Specimen 1) See separate outside reports SPECIMEN SUBMITTED NAME:  **NAME[DDD] Washing, Left:  Negative for malignant cells.\nGROSS DESCRIPTION Specimen one is received fresh for frozen section labeled \\\"anterior tracheal lymph node\\\" and consists of two fragments of grey tan soft tissue measuring 0.9 x 0.2 and the smaller measuring 0.5 x 0.1 x 0.1 cm.  Both are submitted in one cassette for frozen section as 1FS-1. The previously frozen 1FS-1 is entirely resubmitted as 1FS-1. Specimen two is labeled \\\"anterior tracheal lymph node\\\" and consists of a tan fragment of tissue measuring 0.2 cm and another measuring 0.3 cm and another having a longitudinal segment measurement of 1.5 x 0.3 cm. All three fragments are submitted in cassette 2.\nMICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION Review of sections of the anterior tracheal lymph node, 1FS-1 shows infiltrating cancer large cell malignant epithelial tumor in both fragments submitted.  Features are compatible with a metastatic lesion to this lymph node.   After H\\T\\E staining, sections of the anterior tracheal lymph node, 1FS-1, show metastatic cancer, epithelial in character.  Clusters and bundles of tumor is present.  Permanent section of the anterior tracheal lymph node shows clusters and bundles of a large-cell epidermoid  or squamous malignant epithelial tumor.  No keratinization is identified.  Clusters and bundles are rampant throughout the entire fragmented tissue submitted.  No typical lymph node architecture is appreciated.  Deeper sections of the frozen section show the same features. Sections of the anterior tracheal lymph node, 2A-1, show dense clusters of tumor, large-cell, squamous malignant epithelial tumor variety with infiltrating cancer features rampant.  Poor differentiation is appreciated. No keratinization is identified.  Back-to-back tumor clusters are present in small lumps and bundles.  A deeper section of part two shows similar features throughout.   This is a large cell malignant epithelial tumor, non-keratinizing variety. Primary site unknown.\nTISSUE SUBMITTED:  (1) LYMPH NODES, SURGICAL EXCISION Anterior tracheal lymph node (2) LYMPH NODES, SURGICAL EXCISION Anterior tracheal lymph node\n"

Specicmen E is received labeled distal common bile duct, distal stomach, duodenum, head of pancreas; frozen on bile duct pancreatic surgical borders  FS2A-E. It consist of a single piece of tissue consistent with a Whipple procedure as well as two pink cassettes consistent with frozen specimen. The first is labeled FS2A and the other is FS2B. Both are taken and completely resubmitted. The entirety of the Whipple procedure specimen measures 18.1 x 19.9 x 3.6 cm. The window of the pancreas measures 9.2 x 6.3 x 1.9 cm. The uncinate and some of the remnants of pancreatic head were inked in black and the remainder of the peripancreatic soft tissue is inked in blue. There are two stapled surgical surgical borders, one is a proximal/gastric margin surgical margin and another which is distal/duodenal surgical margin. These surgical borders are sectioned off and these surgical borders are taken and submitted. The uncinate resection area is serially sectioned and radial sections of these areas are taken and submitted.  Sectioning into the pancreatic tumor reveals that it has an approximate measurement of 4.3 x 4.4 x 2.1 cm and it appears to be completely contained within the pancreas. This tumor encircles the common bile duct and does not appear to invade or originate from it. The pancreatic duct is non-patent. The common bile duct is probe patent to the ampulla and the ampulla appears to be uninvolved by the tumor. The bowel wall adjacent to the pancreas was also grossly normal and appears to be uninvolved by the tumor. Sections of the tumor in relation to the ampulla and representative sections of the tumor in relationship to the pancreas are taken and submitted. Representative sections of more normal appearing small bowel and stomach are taken and submitted. The perigastric and peripancreatic fat is serially sectioned and totally submitted for potential lymph nodes.

On **DATE[Jan 01 2012], the patient underwent a craniotomy and resection of the left frontal mass which showed metastatic poorly differentiated malignant epithelial tumor.\n\n<GROSS>\nA.  Received in formalin labeled with the patient's name and per the requisition designated 'endobronchial tissue sampling' are six pale tan-pink tissue fragments ranging from less than 0.1 to 0.1 cm in maximum dimension.  The specimen is sectioned in hematoxylin, wrapped and entirely submitted in one cassette.\n**INITIALS  **DATE[Jan 2 12]\nB.  Designated 'bronchial brushing' is a specimen in two parts.  The first consists of 25 cc of clear fluid in CytoLyt fixative which is used to make a monolayer slide.  Also received are two direct smears fixed in alcohol which are stained with a Pap stain.\nC.  Designated 'bronchial washing' is 25 cc of cloudy orange fluid which is used to make a monolayer slide and a cell block.\n\n<MICROSCOPIC>\nA.  Sections show multiple fragments of bronchial tissue in which the mucosa and submucosa are well represented.  A nonspecific chronic inflammatory infiltrate is present within the submucosa.  No small area of inflammations or neoplastic infiltrates are identified.\nB.  The monolayer slide from the bronchial brushing as well as the direct smears show mostly bronchial epithelium and few inflammatory cells.  No malignant cells are identified.\nC.  The monolayer slide and a section from the cell block show clusters of atypical epithelial cells with enlarged nuclei, multiple nucleoli and moderate cytoplasm.  The cells within the cell clusters exhibit pleomorphism and crowding.  Definite features of malignant tumor are not present.\n**INITIALS  **DATE[Jan 2 12]\n\n\n<FINAL DX>\nA.  ENDOBRONCHIAL TISSUE SAMPLING FROM LEFT SUPERIOR SEGMENT, LEFT UPPER LOBE AND LEFT \n  LOWER LOBE:\n  1.  BRONCHIAL TISSUE WITH MILD NONSPECIFIC CHRONIC INFLAMMATION.\n  2.  NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT TUMOR.\nB.  BRONCHIAL BRUSHING:  NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT TUMOR.\nC.  BRONCHIAL WASHING: \n  ATYPICAL CELLS SUSPICIOUS FOR NON-SMALL CELL MALIGNANT EPITHELIAL TUMOR.\n"

The surrounding perinephric fat is inked black. The kidney hilum is identified and has up to 1 cm of attached renal vein and renal artery and 9 cm of attached ureter. The ureter, renal vein and renal artery resection surgical borders are taken en face. The ureter is probe patent into the kidney pelvis. The renal vein is probe patent with no obstructing masses identified. The kidney is bivalved to reveal a 3.8 x 3.0 x 2.8 cm well-circumscribed golden yellow focally hemorrhagic mass with questionable focal extension outside the renal capsule. The mass is 5.6 cm from the closest black inked perinephric fat resection margin, 11 cm from the ureter resection margin, and 3 cm from the renal vein and renal artery resection margin. The mass is located in the mid to upper pole of the kidney. No involvement of the renal pelvis or renal vein is identified. The remaining kidney parenchyma is red/brown and glistening with a well-delineated corticomedullary junction. The renal pelvis is lined by tan glistening urothelium. There is a smooth-walled fluid-filled sac identified in the upper pole of the kidney. The adrenal gland is present in the upper aspect and measures 2.0 x 1.5 x 1.5 cm. Sectioning through the adrenal gland reveals a golden yellow cut surface. No masses or suspicious small lumps are appreciated. No lymph nodes are identified around the hilum. Representative sections are submitted. Summary of sections: A  frozen section residue; B  ureter, renal vein and renal artery resection surgical borders; C-F  mass to include adjacent vasculature and renal pelvis; G-H  possible extension into perinephric fat; I  fluid-filled sac; J  adrenal gland. **INITIALS\nMicroscopic Description The ureter, renal vein, and renal artery surgical borders are all free of tumor. The tumor shows sheets of malignant cells with markedly pleomorphic nuclei and moderate pink granular cytoplasm. Tumor shows some minimal infiltrative characteristics within the adjacent non-cancerous kidney. No vascular space invasion is seen. No extension into the surrounding adipose tissue is seen. The adrenal gland shows no tumor involvement. The fluid-filled sacic area shows no definite lining. A single lymph node is seen in the perirenal area that is replaced by tumor but shows no extracapsular extension.   To further clarify the chromophobe histology a number of immunostains are performed.  All controls stain appropriately including external positive, internal negative and external negative controls as required.  The tumor is positive for EMA, e cadherin, and pankeratin, but negative for vimentin.  The staining pattern is consistent with a chromophobe subtype.  **INITIALS\nAmendments: Electronically Signed Out By **NAME[YYY, XXX M].

This real time PCR assay has been\nvalidated to identify the most common EGFR tyrosine kinase domain mutations\nthat involve exons 18-21. This test is validated for non-small cell lung\nmalignant epithelial tumor. The clinical significance and use of this assay in other tumor\ntypes is not well characterized. Note that this assay is not intended to\ndiagnose any particular type of cancer, but as an aid to clinicians, is\nintended to be used as an adjunct to other prognostic factors to select\neligible patients for therapy. (**NAME[ZZZ:YYY] et al., NEJM 2004;**ID-NUM, Mok\net al., NEJM 2009; **ID-NUM, Pao et al., JClinOnc 2005; **ID-NUM).\nMATERIAL RECEIVED\nA1 = ***PATH-NUMBER[1], 1 Block (**DATE[May 29 2012])\nPROCEDURE DATE\n**DATE[May 22 2012]\nCLIENT REQUEST / CLINICAL HISTORY\nEGFR by PCR \nEGFR PCR METHODS\nThis real time PCR test (Qiagen/DxS) detects the most common activating\nmutations in EGFR, which have been identified in human lung non-small cell\ncancer involving codons 18-21, and leading to the following types of\nmutations: exon 19 deletions (detects any of 19 deletions but does not\ndistinguish between the types), L858R, L861Q, G719X (detects G719S, G719A, and\nG719C, but does not distinguish between the types), S768I, and exon 20\ninsertions (detects any of 3 insertions but does not distinguish between the\ntypes). These mutations account for the vast majority of all activating EGFR\nmutations. Using control materials that contain the L858R and exon 19\ndeletions, which account for ~86% of known EGFR activating mutations, this\nassay has been validated to detect these mutations at a level of 1%. Purified\ngenomic DNA is extracted from microdissected tumor specimen, is analyzed by\nlow volume spectrophotometry, and then used as sample DNA in a real time PCR\nassay using fluorescently labeled and non-labeled primers to detect wild-type\nand mutated EGFR. Sample delta Ct values for mutant and control reactions are\ncalculated and compared against threshold delta Ct values in each mutant\nreaction to determine the presence of each individual mutation type. Negative\nand positive controls are assayed with each sample. The assay sensitivity is\nestimated to be ~1% tumor involvement for each mutation type detected. \nMETHOD LIMITATIONS: Tumor samples are non-homogeneous and data from a sample\nof tumor may not be concordant with data from other sections of the same\ntumor. Tumor samples may also contain non-tumor tissue, and DNA from these\nareas would not be expected to contain a EGFR mutation. Although this assay\nproduces short PCR products, it may not work on heavily fragmented DNA. In\ninstances where the frequency of a target mutation is very low with respect to\nthe wild-type background (<1%), this assay may fail to detect the mutation,\nleading to a false-negative result.     \n    Electronically signed **DATE[Jun 04 2012]: \n**NAME[XXX WWW], MD-Pathologist, IHC Fellow, Pathologist\nPer CMS regulations, the pathologist's signature above indicates that this\ncase has been reviewed and the diagnosis made or confirmed by said\npathologist.\nNote: Some of the tests reported here may have been developed and performance\ncharacteristics determined by PhenoPath Laboratories. They have not been\ncleared or approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). However,\nthe FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary.\nPursuant to the requirements of CLIA, this laboratory has established and\nverified the accuracy and precision of all tests, and additional information\nabout these tests is available upon request.

PATHOLOGIST's COMMENTS  See Microscopic Description  \nGROSS DESCRIPTION  Received fresh labeled \"left breast mass\" is an 11.5 gram oriented portion of yellow, lobulated, partially disrupted adipose tissue measuring 4.1 x 3.8 x 1.8 cm (medial to lateral, anterior to posterior, superior to inferior).  A short suture denotes superior and a long suture denotes lateral per requisition.  There is a penetrating needle localization wire near one of the partially disrupted area at the anterior aspect.  The specimen is inked as follows:  superior - blue, inferior - green, medial - orange, lateral - violet, anterior - red and posterior - black. /pb/kb  Sectioning of the tissue reveals yellow lobulated glistening cut surfaces.  There is a 1.1 x 0.8 x 0.3 cm hemorrhagic cavity possibly representing a prior tissue sampling site.  The cavity is focally surrounded by pink tan fibrous tissue.  The fibrous areas are within 0.2 cm of the anterior resection margin.  The specimen is sequentially submitted entirely as follows:  1.  perpendicular sections of deep margin 2-7.  one whole cross section in each cassette with cassettes 5 through 7 containing the fibrous areas 8.  remainder of anterior margin 9.  remainder of medial margin  Time received in Lab - 11:39 Time placed in formalin - 11:40 Time sectioned and replaced in formalin - 2:00  The specimen is accompanied by a radiograph            /pb/as \nMICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION  Sections show the site of previous breast tissue sampling showing scarring process with fat tissue death and chronic inflammation.

Numerous plasma cells are within stroma.  Only rare mitotic\nactivity is seen.  The majority of the tumor is nodular and\nwell-circumscribed but infiltrative tubules are seen at the base of tumor.\nThese findings are of an apocrine tumor that is most consistent with a\nsyringofluid-filled sacadenoma papilliferum but the infiltrative border is concerning\nfor the development of second tumor (such as a tubular adenoma or eccrine\npapillary adenoma) or possibly malignant transformation.  Therefore,\ncomplete excision is recommended as the lesion is transected at a\nperipheral margin.  This case was reviewed at the Department Consensus\nConference.\n\nINTRAOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:\nFSA.

Container designation: \"uterus, ovaries, fibroma\" --  Received fresh\nis a 235.5 gram specimen including an unopened uterus measuring 9.5 x 8.5 x\n6.0 cm, right fallopian tube measuring 5.5 cm with a diameter of 0.3 cm,\nleft fallopian tube measuring 7.5 cm with a diameter of 0.3 cm, left ovary\nmeasuring 4. x 3.0 x 1.5 cm, right ovary measuring 2.5 x 2.0x 1.0 cm.\nPlease note that the left ovary is fluctuant and is opened to reveal clear\nwatery fluid and a simple fluid-filled sacic lining.  The exocervix measures 1.5 x 1.3\ncm covered with glistening white mucosa.  The external os is circular and\nmeasures 0.4 cm in diameter and the endocervical canal 4.4 cm in length.\nThe endometrial cavity measures 5.5 cm cornu to cornu.  There is a\ntan-white intramural whorled small lump measuring 5.0 x 4.5 x 4.0 cm that\ngrossly distorts the endometrial cavity.  This small lump is sectioned to\nreveal tan-white whorled areas without apparent tissue death, bleeding or\ncalcifications.  There is a 2.3 x 1.5 cm anterior heaped up gray mass that\ndoes not appear to grossly invade the myometrium.  A 2.9 x 1.8 cm posterior\ntan-gray heaped up mass in the posterior uterus that also does not appear\nto grossly invade the endometrium.  There is possible adenomyosis noted\nthroughout the myometrium.  Myometrial thickness measures 2.5 cm in maximal\nthickness.  The serosa is smooth and glistening without noted adhesions.\nThe fallopian tubes are patent and have fimbriated ends.  The right ovary\nis white with a smooth outer surface.  The left ovary is white, fluctuant\nand opened to reveal simple fluid-filled sacs with serous fluid.

There is some squamous metaplasia with mild atypia at the bronchial margin, however.  The tumor is very close to the bronchial margin, as the subsequent section shows infiltrating cancer tumor within the bronchial wall.  Permanent sections confirm the frozen section diagnoses.

Final Signout: **NAME[XXX WWW], MD **DATE[Oct 23 12]\nFINAL DIAGNOSIS: LEFT ILIAC WING, TISSUE SAMPLING METASTATIC POORLY DIFFERENTIATED MALIGNANT EPITHELIAL TUMOR, SEE COMMENT.\nGROSS DESCRIPTION: The specimen is received in a container labeled with the patient's name, number, date and \\\"left iliac tissue sampling.\\\"  The specimen is received in formalin and consists of multiple longitudinal, cylindrically-shaped portion of glistening tan-white material, measuring 1 x < 0.1 cm. in aggregate.  The specimen is totally submitted in one block.\nCOMMENT WORD: Sections of the left iliac wing tissue sampling show the presence of a non-small cell type malignant epithelial tumor, present in organoid sheets and nests with a faint pseudoglandular appearance.  The cells are large with abundant cytoplasm and centrally located ovoid nuclei with vesicular chromatin and prominent central nucleoli.  No attempts at keratinization are identified.  Tumor infiltrates within fibrous tissue and adjacent skeletal muscle fragments.  Tumor cells stain negatively with Napsin, TTF-1, and p63.  Although this does not exclude a lung primary, it makes it less likely.  Further immunostains are pending to include Mart-1 and S-100 and a separate report will follow.\nSpecimen Number: ***PATH-NUMBER[1]. Tissues: Ilium. Specimen Comments:\n"

SURGICAL SURGICAL BORDERS: NOT INVOLVED. PATHOLOGIC CLASSIFICATION OF CANCER EXTENT:  pT2, N0, MX.. Final Signout: **NAME[XXX WWW], MD **DATE[Feb 30 12]\nGROSS DESCRIPTION: The specimen is received within formalin in one container labeled right colon with terminal ileum and consists of a right hemi-colectomy specimen, as follows:  There is a segment of terminal ileum that measures 6 cm. in length x 4 cm. in circumference, and a segment of right colon that measures 19 cm. in length x 8 cm. in circumference.  When opening, there is a large growth protruding from a mucous membraneoid-fungating tumor mass at the cecum which extensively involves the ileocecal valve and measures 6.2 x 5.5 x 2 cm. The mass, on sectioning, is fragile, easily detaches from the underlying colonic mucosa and does not appear to invade the colonic wall.  The remaining mucosa shows no additional lesion.  Also, the appendix is present and measures 7.5 cm. in length x 0.5 cm. in diameter.  On sectioning, it is unremarkable.  Representative sections are submitted in twenty cassettes - from \"A\" through \"T\", as follows:  \"A\" - proximal and distal margin; \"B\" through \"O\" - growth protruding from a mucous membraneoid mass entirely submitted; \"P\" - appendix; \"Q\" - one lymph node bisected; \"R\", \"S\", \"T\" - multiple lymph nodes in each cassette.\nTissues: COLON SEG RESECT. Specimen Comments: CPT CODES: 88309 x 1\n"

The central portion of the specimen is narrowed.  On section, a 2 x 1 cm ulceration is centrally identified with wide proximal and distal surgical borders.  On section, the wall is thickened and scarring process extends into the peri-colic fat.  Representative sections of ulcer are submitted in cassettes 1 through 5.  The tumor is between 4 to 5 cm from the distal and proximal surgical borders of resection.  A representative section of each margin is submitted in cassette 6.  Possible lymph nodes are submitted through cassette 13.\nMicroscopicDescription:\nSigmoid colon:  Sections demonstrate an infiltrating cancer glandular cancer.  Complex glands invade through the muscularis into the peri-colic fat.  Solid tumor areas are noted with bizarre tumor cells. Solid areas of tumor are felt to represent less than 50% of tumor mass.  1 of 17 regional nodes demonstrates evidence of metastatic malignant epithelial tumor.  In this particular node, the node is located in the immediate peri-colic fat and the tumor is less 2 mm in dimension.  Peri-vascular tumor invasion is noted.  Perineural invasion is also appreciated.   The surgical surgical borders are free of tumor.\nA: Sigmoid colon\n"

Submitted fresh specimen A is labeled LEFT KIDNEY PARENCHYMA FS and consists of two pieces of yellow maroon tissue measuring 2.0 x 0.5 x 0.4 cm.  The resubmitted frozen section tissue is totally embedded in cassette A. B.     Submitted in formalin specimen B is labeled COLON and consists of a colon segment 73 cm in length x a diameter ranging from 2.5 up to 3.5 cm. The serosal area is light tan  pink maroon with a small area of serosal scarring process.  Opening the colon displays an ulcerating and growth protruding from a mucous membraneoid circumferential mass measuring 3.5 x 3.5 x 1.5 cm and extends to within 4.5 cm of the nearest margin.  Prior to sectioning of the mass the serosal margin is inked in black.    Sections display the mass to extend through the muscularis propria and focally into pericolonic adipose tissue.  On the antimesenteric side the tumor appears to focally extend to the subserosa without definitive serosal involvment.  The remaining colon displays approximately the five small growth protruding from a mucous membranes ranging from 0.3 up to 0.5 cm in greatest dimension.  In addition a central mucosal area with green discoloration is identified measuring 0.9 cm in dimension.  Small diverticula are also grossly seen.  No additional masses are grossly identified.  An additional portion of omentum is identified in the specimen container measuring 19.5 x 8.0 x 1.5 cm.  Sectioning shows no gross abnormalities.    Sections of the tumor mass are submitted in cassettes B1  B4, a section of the nearest margin is submitted in cassette B5, sections of the additional mucosal growth protruding from a mucous membranes are submitted in cassette B6, sections of diverticula and green gangrenous area are submitted in cassette B7, section of omentum is submitted in cassette B8, three possible lymph nodes are submitted in cassette B9, a single piece of fibroadipose tissue with associated vascular structures and possible positive lymph nodes is submitted in cassette B10, and additional possible lymph nodes are submitted in cassettes B11- B14. C.     Submitted in formalin specimen C is labeled COLON GROWTH PROTRUDING FROM A MUCOUS MEMBRANE and consists of a large mucosal growth protruding from a mucous membrane measuring 2.5 x 2.4 x 2.3 cm. Sectioning shows a friable growth protruding from a mucous membrane without definitive evidence of gross invasion.  Specimen is totally embedded in cassettes C1  C4. D.

GAR Intraoperative Consultation(s) Frozen section diagnosis: A. Adipose tissue with scarring process, inflammation and histiocytes.  Negative for malignant tumor. (GAR).\nMicroscopic Description A.          Permanent sections of the resubmitted frozen section tissue shows adipose tissue with areas of fat tissue death, scarring process, mild to moderate acute and chronic inflammation with hemosiderin ladened macrophages and associated blood.  No evidence of malignant tumor is seen. B.     Sections of the submitted colon tumor shows irregular tortuous, fluid-filled sacically dilated and cribriforming malignant glands showing significant nuclear pleomorphism with enlarged vesicular nuclei showing occasional inconspicuous nucleoli, minimal pseudostratification and areas of central tissue death consistent with a moderately differentiated glandular cancer.  The tumor is seen extending through the muscularis propria and into the pericolonic adipose tissue and elicits a minimal to moderate lymphocytic response.  Occasional areas suspicious for vascular infiltration by cancer are seen.  The serosal surgical borders are free of involvement. A section of the nearest proximal margin is negative for malignant tumor.  Sections of the additional mucosal growth protruding from a mucous membranes display additional tubular adenomas with mild abnormal cell growth and hyperplastic growth protruding from a mucous membranes.  No evidence of additional evidence of malignant tumor is seen.  Sections of the diverticuli display a single diverticulus with associated adipose tissue showing a non-cancerous lymphoid aggregate.  Additionally, an area of green discoloration shows associated tissue death with significant acute inflammation, swelling from fluid accumulation and muscularis degeneration.  No evidence of malignant tumor is seen. A section of the omentum shows no significant histopathologic abnormalities.  Sections of the submitted lymph nodes display the palpable lymph node to be replaced by malignant glands consistent with metastatic colonic glandular cancer. Sections of the remaining lymph nodes display an additional twelve lymph nodes negative for metastatic malignant epithelial tumor. C.     Sections of the totally embedded mucosal growth protruding from a mucous membranes show the growth protruding from a mucous membrane to display a tubular and villous architectural pattern with surface epithelium showing nuclear hyperchromasia, pseudostratification and moderate loss of basal nuclear orientation.  Mild stroma swelling from fluid accumulation with chronic inflammatory cells is seen.  No evidence of infiltrating cancer malignant tumor is seen.

NEGATIVE FOR PAPILLARY MALIGNANT EPITHELIAL TUMOR.\nGROSS: Received un-fixed for frozen section designated \\\"left thyroid and isthmus\\\" is a 14-gram portion of red-tan thyroid tissue containing a large small lump.  The specimen measures 4.6 x 2.5 x 3.1 cm.  The small lump measures 4.3 x 2.3 x 2.0 cm.  The surgical removal of tissue surgical borders are inked.  The external surface is red and smooth.  Sections through the gland show a well circumscribed, tan small lump with a partial definite capsule.  The small lump has a granular, yellow tan cut surface.  Scrape preps are prepared.  A representative portion is submitted for frozen section in cassette FS.  FROZEN SECTION DIAGNOSIS:  PAPILLARY MALIGNANT EPITHELIAL TUMOR.  Results called to Dr. **NAME[YYY] on **DATE[Nov 05 11] at 2:00 p.m.  Additional sections of the tumor are submitted in cassettes A thru F.  DT: **DATE[Nov 05 11]  Part 2 is received in formalin designated \\\"right thyroid gland\\\" is a lobe of tan thyroid tissue weighing 6 grams and measuring 4.5 x 1.7 x 1.7 cm.  The surgical removal of tissue surgical borders are inked.  The cut surface is homogeneous, red and tan.  The entire lobe is submitted in cassettes #2A thru #2F.  DT: **DATE[Nov 06 11]\nMICRO: Sections from the left lobe of the gland show a partially encapsulated 4.3 cm focus of papillary malignant epithelial tumor.  The tumor is limited to the thyroid gland and does not involve the surgical removal of tissue surgical borders.  The tumor is composed of complex, branching, and randomly oriented papillae with a lining of cuboidal cells.  The nuclear features of papillary malignant epithelial tumor are present.  A few cells demonstrate nuclear grooves and many cells demonstrate ground glass nuclei.  Psammoma bodies are also present.  A single normal parathyroid gland is identified.DT: **DATE[Nov 06 11] (DRB, bsp)  Sections from the right lobe of the thyroid show a well-circumscribed follicular small lump with a fibrous capsule.  This small lump most likely represents a follicular adenoma. Sections adjacent to the small lump show non-cancerous thyroid parenchyma with focal chronic inflammation.  There is no evidence of papillary malignant epithelial tumor or follicular malignant epithelial tumor in the right thyroid lobe.  DT: **DATE[Nov 07 11] (DRB, bsp)\nPROCEDURE: Total thyroidectomy. SPECIMEN(S): 1) Left thyroid and isthmus.  2) Right thyroid.\n"

The core tissue sampling has groups of atypical cells arranged in\nglandular configurations, with hyperchromatic vesicular enlarged nuclei.\nThe background is fibrotic and has a lymphoid infiltrate.\n\nIMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY STUDY:\nDeparaffinized sections of formalin-fixed tissue and the appropriate\ncontrols are incubated with a panel of antibodies or a specific\nfluorescein-labeled (oligo)nucleotide probe.  Localization is via one or\nall of the following three systems: Alkaline Phosphatase multimer-based\nmethod, indirect biotin streptavidin immunoperoxidase method, and biotin\nfree multimer immunoperoxidase method.

This real time\nPCR assay has been validated to identify the most common EGFR tyrosine\nkinase domain mutations that involve exons 18-21. This test is validated\nfor non-small cell lung malignant epithelial tumor. The clinical significance and use of\nthis assay in other tumor types is not well characterized. Note that\nthis assay is not intended to diagnose any particular type of cancer,\nbut as an aid to clinicians, is intended to be used as an adjunct to\nother prognostic factors to select eligible patients for therapy.

Addendum Comment Since issuing the initial report we have stained the infiltrating cancer component of tumor with P16 which is negative.  The overlying squamous epithelium shows patchy weak to moderate staining which is not identifying disease and the infiltrating cancer malignant epithelial tumor is completely negative. This militates against the tumor being HPV related. The immunohistochemical test(s) were developed and the performance characteristics determined by the **INSTITUTION Pathology.  It has not been cleared or approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.  The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary.  This test is used for clinical purposes.  It should not be regarded as investigational or for research.

This\nimmunophenotype and limited morphologic findings are characteristic for\nCLL, or small lymphocytic lymphoma (with hematologic involvement if there\nis predominant lymphadenopathy). The absence of CD38 expression in CLL is\nassociated with better outcome. Cytogenetic analysis is pending.  Please\nsee separate report.\n\nThis test was developed and its performance characteristics determined by\nXXXXX. It has not been cleared or approved by the\nU.S. Food and Drug Administration.

The morphological findings and\nimmunophenotyping are most consistent with chronic lymphocytic blood cancer/\nsmall lymphocytic lymphoma. Some erythroid precursors show slight\nmegaloblastic change.  No other significant dysplastic features are\nidentified.  The morphological findings are insufficient for diagnosis of\nmyeloabnormal cell growth.

The staple line measures \n8 cm.  The pleural surfaces are inked black.  \n\nSections reveal a tan-white and firm circumscribed small lump measuring up to 2 cm in greatest dimension, and is within less than 0.5 cm from the nearest staple line.  Upon removal of staple line, the tumor is immediately adjacent and identified at the margin.  Adjacent sections are tan-gray with black tumor tissues, which grossly appears to be at the resection margin.  The mass does not appear to be grossly involving the pleural surface, however there appears to a torn or lacerated area adjacent the tumor.  The pleural parenchyma adjacent to the mass is predominantly tan-red and soft with scattered gray pigmentation.  No other firm masses or circumscribed lesions noted.  \n\nA representative section of the small lump is submitted for frozen section in one cassette.  All tumor sections submitted in cassettes A1 - A7, with the section of tumor nearest staple line in cassette A4.  Random sections in cassettes A8 - A10.\n\n(B)  Received in formalin labeled \"level 9 lymph node\" is a tan-red, brown and soft tissue fragment measuring 0.9 x 0.7 x 0.5 cm.  All in one cassette.\n\n(C)  Received in formalin labeled \"level 10 lymph node\" is a tan-red, brown and soft tissue fragment measuring 1.1 x 0.7 x 0.5 cm.  All in one cassette.\n\n(D)  Received fresh labeled \"level 10 lymph node\" is a 1 x 0.5 x 0.3 cm tan-red, brown and soft tissue fragment.  The specimen is bisected and submitted entirely for frozen section in one cassette.\n\n(E)  Received fresh labeled \"right lower lobe (for bronchial margin)\" is a lung lobectomy specimen measuring 18 x 10 x 3 cm.  There are three staple lines measuring up to 12 cm.  The pleural surfaces are purple-red with scattered black and white pigmentation.  The surfaces are generally smooth.  On one edge of the lobe is a tan-white and soft unremarkable pleural parenchyma measuring 7 x 1.5 cm.  The stapled resection surgical borders are inked black.  Sections reveal a predominantly maroon-red and soft pleural parenchyma with scattered gray-black and white spicules.  Areas along the staple line are predominantly dark maroon-red and homogeneous.  No circumscribed masses or lesions noted.  \n\nThe bronchial surgical borders appear grossly unremarkable.  \n\nRepresentative sections are submitted in eleven cassettes, with the bronchial margin submitted for frozen section in cassette EFS.  Random sections from staple line in cassettes E1 and E2, random pleural parenchyma E3 - E9, and sections from bronchial margin in cassette E10. \n\n(F)  Received in formalin labeled \"4R lymph node\" are two red-brown, black and soft tissue fragments measuring 0.6 x 0.5 x 0.3 cm and 1.4 x 0.8 x 0.5 cm.  The large fragment is bisected.  Submitted entirely in one cassette.\n\n(G)  Received in formalin labeled \"level 7 lymph node\" is a red-brown, black and soft tissue fragment measuring 1.3 x 0.7 x 0.5 cm.  All in one cassette.\nMicroscopicDescription:\nA - G.

All internal and external controls were appropriately reactive.\nThe steroid receptor result is positive if at least 1% of tumor cell nuclei\nshow specific staining. For positive cases the \"fraction of cells staining\"\nis a visual estimate subject to observer variation. Her2 membrane\npositivity was scored according to **NAME[ZZZ] ASCP/CAP consensus (J Clin Oncol\n25:188, 2007):  0-1+ is negative for overexpression, 2+ is equivocal, and\n3+ is positive.\nGROSS DESCRIPTION:  Number of specimen containers: 4.  Labeled with name\nand date of birth:  **NAME[AAA BBB] and **DATE[Oct 22 1958]\nA.   Container designation: \"left breast\" --  The specimen consists of a 66\ngram, simple mastectomy specimen measuring 14.2 x 7.3 x up to 1.8 cm,\npartially surfaced with a 12 x 4.3 cm non-nipple bearing skin ellipse.  The\nspecimen is oriented with \"one clip superior\", \"two clips lateral\" and\n\"deep is on implant\" per the requisition slip.  The skin has two flat dark\nbrown lesions (0.3 and 0.5 cm) and two scars (a circular scar with a\ndiameter of 5.3 cm that has a second central 1.8 x 1.0 cm scar).  The\nspecimen is inked as follows: superior   red, inferior   green, medial\norange, lateral   yellow, anterior   skin, posterior   black.  Sectioning\nreveals a 1.0 x 0.7 x 0.5 cm thickened possible lesion that abuts the\nnearest deep margin and is 5 mm from the nearest superior margin.  The\nremaining specimen is fatty with no significant fibrous tissue or\nadditional lesions. No lymph nodes are present on the lateral aspect of the\nspecimen.   Cassette: A1   skin lesions, A2   skin scars, A3-A6   entire\npossible lesion, A7-A10   representative sections of remaining specimen,\nincluding surgical borders.\n                       Formalin fixation time: 9-11 hours.\nB.   Container designation: \"axillary tissue left side\" --  Received fresh\nfor intraoperative consultation is a 3.5 x 2.0 x 0.9 cm portion of yellow\nlobulated adipose tissue.  The specimen is sectioned to reveal no discrete\nlymph nodes.  Cassettes: entirely submitted in B1-B3.\nINTRAOPERATIVE CONSULTATION DIAGNOSIS   AXILLARY TISSUE: NO GROSS TUMOR OR\nLYMPH NODE (XX)\nC.   Container designation: \"right breast\" --  Received fresh for\nintraoperative consultation is a 528.5 gram, 22 x 17 x 3 cm simple\nmastectomy specimen, partially surfaced with a 7.5 x 4.9 cm central nipple\nbearing skin ellipse. The breast has a clip on one end designated \"clip in\naxilla\" per the requisition slip. The skin has a scar surrounding the\nareola and a 0.3 cm dark brown flat lesion at the 3:00 edge.  A 0.7 x 0.3 x\n0.2 cm calcified focus is present at approximately 6:30, 2 cm from the\nnipple and 1 cm from all surgical borders.  The remaining specimen contains about\n40% thickened fluid-filled sacic multinodular fibrous stroma.  No discrete lesions are\ngrossly identified.  No lymph nodes are present on the lateral aspect of\nthe specimen.  Cassettes: C1   nipple and skin including lesion and scar,\nC2-C3   upper outer quadrant, including anterior margin at 10:00, 2 cm from\nthe skin edge, C4-C5   lower outer quadrant, including fibrous tissue and\nanterior margin at approximately 6:30, 1 cm from skin edge, C6-C7   lower\ninner quadrant including anterior margin at approximately 3:30, 2.5 cm from\nskin edge, C8-C9   upper inner quadrant including anterior margin at\napproximately 2:30, 2.5 cm from skin edge, and C10   calcified focus, after\ndecalcification.\n      Formalin fixation time: 8.5   10.5 hours.\nINTRAOPERATIVE CONSULTATION DIAGNOSIS   RIGHT BREAST: SURGICAL BORDERS GROSSLY\nNEGATIVE (XX)\nD.   Container designation: \"right axillary contents\" --  Received fresh\nfor intraoperative cytology are two lymph nodes, 0.7 and 1.3 cm.  The\nsmaller node is uninked and bisected, the larger node is inked blue and\nbisected longitudinally.  Scrape preps are performed.  Cassettes: D1\nsmaller lymph node, D2   larger lymph node.\nINTRAOPERATIVE CYTOLOGY DIAGNOSIS   R AXILLARY NODE: NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR\n(XX)\nE.   Container designation: \"Additional right axillary contents\" --  The\nspecimen consists of a 7.0 x 6.5 x 2.5 cm aggregate of fat containing three\npossible lymph nodes measuring up to 1.0 cm.

MALIGNANT PHYLLODES TUMOR\n  2.  TUMOR FOCALLY WITHIN 1 MM OF THE INFERIOR MARGIN\n\nBreast Tumor Information:\nType of specimen(s):  Lumpectomy, right breast\nHistologic Type:  Phyllodes tumor, Malignant\nSize:    7.5 x 6.5 x 4.5 cm\nMitotic rate:  Up to 11 per 10 hpfs\nCellularity:  High\nResection surgical borders:  Negative; Within 1 mm focally (inferior margin)\nOther findings:  Stomal overgrow present\n    Satellite small lump present.\nDiagnosisComment:\nThis case was reviewed in consultation by pathologists at UCSF (see ***PATH-NUMBER[1]).  The following paragraphs are taken from the comments in the consultation report:\n\n\"Based on the gross description and the microscopic sections, the right lumpectomy shows two apparent masses that are juxtaposed to each other with abrupt transition in morphologic features (best demonstrated on slide 11).  The larger mass is composed of proliferation of highly cellular spindle cells growing in interweaving fascicles with no obvious epithelial differentiation.  Rare elongated non-cancerous tubules are noted within the periphery of the spindle cell mass.  the spindle cells have pale eosinophilic cytoplasm and indistinct cell borders.  The nuclei show a vesicular chromatin pattern with inconspicuous nucleoli.  Mitotic activity varies regionally, but overall is moderate to high, and measures up to 11 mitotic figures/10hpfs.  No tissue death is identified.  No heterologous elements (such as lipogenic or chondroid differentiation) are identified in the slides available for review.  Although the mass has an overall well-circumscribed contour, irregular large tongues of growth and microscopic infiltration into adjacent fat are noted, and a small satellite small lump is seen on slide 26.  \n\nThe smaller small lump shows a fibroepithelial lesion that in some areas with paucicellular stroma is reminiscent of a fibroadenoma, but in other areas displaying increased stromal cellularity and mitotic activity (I found 2 mitotic figures in one high power field on slide 8) beyond what would be seen in fibroadenomas and would place this small lump into the category of phyllodes tumor.\n\nBased on the presence of a phyllodes tumor in the smaller small lump and the juxtaposition of the two small lumps, the differential diagnosis for the larger mass with cellular spindle cells would most likely be part of the phyllodes tumor as the result of stromal overgrowth.  Other consideration includes metaplastic malignant epithelial tumor or less likely other mesenchymal tumors. \n\nThe following stains were performed and interpreted at HMC: CD34 patchy positivity, SMA positive, S-100 negative , Desmin negative, LCA negative, Oscar/keratin negative.  The following stains were performed at UCSF: keratin MNF1 negative, p63 negative.  \n\nNegative staining for epithelial markers and p63 helps exclude the possibility of a metaplastic breast malignant epithelial tumor.  Negative S100 and desmin argues against skin cancer and leiomyomalignant tumor of connective tissue respectively.  The histologic features are not those of  an angiomalignant tumor of connective tissue.  Patchy positivity for CD34 can be seen in the stromal component of phyllodes tumors.  Furthermore, the presence of rare elongated non-cancerous tubules within the large mass also supports this as phyllodes tumor.\n\nThis phyllodes tumor is further categorized as malignant based on stromal overgrowth with highly cellular stroma, high mitotic activity, and irregular infiltrative border.  \n\nBased on slides available for review, surgical borders are negative but close (<1mm to yellow inked inferior margin) and at least one satellite small lump is noted.  Ideally, treatment for malignant phyllodes tumors should include widely clear surgical borders (1 cm if possible).  Therefore, close follow-up is recommended for return of disease, and re-excision may merit consideration.\"  \n\nPreliminary findings called to the office of Dr. **NAME[ZZZ YYY] on **DATE[May 29 12].\nGrossDescription:\nReceived in formalin, labeled \"right breast lumpectomy\" is a lumpectomy specimen consisting of a strip of tan skin (7 x 0.5 x 0.5 cm) with attached rubbery tan-yellow tissue (8.5 x 8.5 x 6 cm).  Metal tags mark the cranial/superior margin, caudal/inferior margin, medial margin and lateral margin.  The specimen is differentially inked as follows: superior-blue ink, inferior-yellow ink, anterior-black ink, posterior-green ink, medial and lateral-red ink.  \n\nThe specimen is serially sectioned into fourteen lamellae from medial (lamella 1) to lateral (lamella 14) direction.  A large circumscribed, soft to rubbery pink-tan mass (7.5 x 6.5 x 4.5 cm) has a uniform cut surface and is found within lamellae 1 through 13.  The mass grossly approaches to within 1.5 cm of the superior margin, 0.1 cm of the inferior margin, 0.1 cm of the anterior margin, 0.2 cm of the posterior margin, 0.4 cm of the medial margin and 0.6 cm of the lateral margin.  \n\nAlso found in lamellae 4 through 10 is a well-circumscribed rubbery firm and fibrous white small lump (4.2 x 3 x 2.5 cm) which is found adjacent and superior to the previously described mass.  A tissue sampling clip is found in lamella 8 within the fibrous small lump.  Remainder of the specimen consists of fibroadipose tissue tissue.  Representative sections are submitted as follows:\n\nBlock Summary:\n1.  -  Lamella 1, representative perpendicular sections of medial margin, mass.\n2.  -  Lamella 2, anterior section, mass.\n3.  -  Lamella 3, inferior and anterior section, mass.\n4.  -  Lamella 4, superior and anterior section, fibrous small lump.\n5.  -  Lamella 4, inferior and anterior section, mass.\n6.  -  Lamella 5, anterior section, fibrous small lump and mass.\n7.  -  Lamella 5, inferior and anterior section, mass.\n8.  -  Lamella 6, superior and anterior section, fibrous small lump.\n9.  -  Lamella 6, anterior section, fibrous small lump and mass.\n10.  -  Lamella 7, superior and anterior section, fibrous small lump.\n11.  -  Lamella 7, anterior section, fibrous small lump and mass.\n12.  -  Lamella 7, inferior and anterior section, mass.\n13.  -  Lamella 8, superior and anterior section, fibrous small lump.\n14.  -  Lamella 8, anterior section, fibrous small lump and mass, location of tissue sampling clip.\n15.  -  Lamella 8, anterior section, fibrous small lump and mass.\n16.  -  Lamella 8, posterior section, fibrous small lump and mass.\n17.  -  Lamella 8, skin and anterior section, mass.\n18.  -  Lamella 8, inferior section, mass.\n19.  -  Lamella 9, superior and anterior section, fibrous small lump.\n20.  -  Lamella 9, superior and posterior section, fibrous small lump.\n21.  -  Lamella 9, inferior and posterior section, mass.\n22.  -  Lamella 10, superior and anterior section, fibrous small lump.\n23.  -  Lamella 10, inferior and posterior section, mass.\n24.  -  Lamella 11, superior and posterior section.\n25.  -  Lamella 11, skin and anterior section, mass.\n26.  -  Lamella 11, posterior section, mass.\n27.  -  Lamella 12, anterior and posterior section, mass.\n28.  -  Lamella 12, posterior section, mass.\n29.  -  Lamella 12, inferior and anterior section, mass.\n30.  -  Lamella 13, posterior section, mass.\n31-32.  -  Lamella 14, representative perpendicular sections of lateral margin.\n\nThe specimen was received in formalin on **DATE[May 21 12] at 15:15 hours, for a total fixation time of approximately 29.5 hours.\nMicroscopicDescription:\nThe microscopic findings support the diagnosis.\nA: Right breast lumpectomy\n"

Container designation: \"left breast mastectomy\" --  The specimen\nconsists of an oriented (short superior, long lateral), 140 gram, 15.0 x\n12.5 x 2.5 cm simple left mastectomy.  The mastectomy is surfaced by a 16.5\nx 5.0 cm blue-dyed nipple bearing skin ellipse. The nipple has superficial\nsloughing skin but is not retraced.  Also received separate unattached is a\n4.5 x 2.0 x 1.5 cm additional portion of fatty soft tissue. The mastectomy\ndeep margin is inked black, the anterior margin is inked blue and the most\nlateral skin edge is overlaid with red ink.  There is a 2.6 x 1.5 x 1.0 cm\nirregular bordered fibrotic area at 2 o'clock, 3.0 cm from the nipple.  The\nfibrotic area is 1.5 cm or greater from the inked surgical borders.  The fibrotic\narea contains a hemorrhagic tissue sampling site containing an intraparenchymal\nmetallic marking clip.  There are no other fibrotic areas or mass lesions\nidentified.  The remainder of the specimen is predominantly fat admixed\nwith a minimal amount of fibrous tissue (15%).  There are no lesions\nunderlying the nipple and no lymph nodes identified at the lateral aspect\nof the specimen.  The separately received portion of unoriented fatty soft\ntissue is inked green.  The cut surfaces are vascular with no lymph nodes\nor mass lesions identified.

The accompanying report is also received.\nMicroscopicDescription:\n  The slides are from the right middle lobe biopsies per the accompanied report and consist of several fragments of bronchial mucosa as well as portion of alveolated lung parenchyma.  Both the bronchial mucosa and the alveolated lung parenchyma show several groups of malignant cells with features consistent with poorly differentiated malignant epithelial tumor present in lymphatic vessels.  The tumor cells have large pleomorphic hyperchromatic nuclei and eosinophilic, slightly vacuolated cytoplasm.  The immunoperoxidase stains which are received show the tumor cells to be strongly positive for CK7 and negative for CK20, CDX2, P63 and TTF1.  The morphologic features, in conjunction with this immunophenotype, are consistent with a non small cell malignant epithelial tumor with features favoring an glandular cancer and although a primary lung glandular cancer cannot be ruled out, other sites should also be considered.  Clinical and imaging correlation is recommended.\n1: Outside slide consult charge\n"

Mucin production is present, but is not a prominent feature.  The ovarian serous malignant epithelial tumor is also growing in a glandular pattern, but it lacks the slit-like spaces of the endometrial tumor, and shows much more mucin production.  In addition, no involvement of the ovarian surface, bilateral parametria, or uterine serosa was observed.  These features would favor two synchronous primaries.  However, the ovarian tumor has a fluid-filled sacic background and consists entirely of intraepithelial malignant epithelial tumor, with no lower-grade \\\"borderline\\\" areas observed.  This is distinctly unusual, and a spread of cancer cannot be excluded.  If the ovarian tumor represents a spread of cancer from the endometrium, the endometrial stage would be pT3a.  Clinical correlation is suggested.      P53 immunohistochemical stains were performed on both the ovarian and endometrial tumors and were both positive, confirming serous subtype.  Given the mucin production of the ovarian tumor, a CK20 immunohistochemical stain was also performed to exclude a colonic spread of cancer, and was negative.  This case was reviewed at the Intradepartmental Consensus Conference.
