Final Signout: **NAME[ZZZ M YYY], XXX] PhD **DATE[Dec 04 11]\nFINAL DIAGNOSIS: LEFT UPPER LOBE OF LUNG, BIOPSY BRONCHIAL BIOPSY WITH FEATURES OF ADENOCARCINOMA. SEE COMMENT.\nGROSS DESCRIPTION: The specimen is received in a container labeled with the patient's name, number, date and \\\"biopsy left upper lobe.\\\"  The specimen is received in formalin and consists of a fragment of white-tan tissue, measuring less than 1 mm. in greatest dimensions.  The specimen is totally submitted in one block.\nCOMMENT WORD: The microscopic sections of biopsy from the left upper lobe of the lung reveal a proliferation of epithelial cells demonstrating mild atypia and forming gland-like structures.  The cells contain slightly enlarged, hyperchromatic nuclei with punctuate, variably sized nucleoli.  There is cellular crowding with occasional mitotic figures.  The findings are felt to indicate the presence of adenocarcinoma consistent with a lung primary. The findings should be correlated with clinical history and symptomatology.\nSpecimen Number: ***PATH-NUMBER[2]. Tissues: Left upper lobe of lung. Specimen Comments:\n"

Principle  HER-2/neu FISH testing is performed in compliance with the ASCO/CAP guidelines. The procedure in use has been modified from the FDA approved procedure (PathVysion from Vysis) by increasing the enzyme digestion to 20 minutes and using DAPI II as a counterstain.  The Flow Cytometry Laboratory takes responsibility for test performance, and the validation performed has proven extremely high between IHC and FISH.  Tissue sections are deparaffinized, pretreated and digested, then probed and incubated overnight, along with appropriate controls.  Two separate probes are used from Vysis:  a Spectrum Orange Her-2 probe that is locus-specific and a Spectrum Green centromere probe for Chromosome 17.  The slides are counterstained with DAPI to produce an enhanced visualization of probe reactivity.  Analysis  The slides are viewed under a fluorescent microscope. The level of HER-2 gene amplification is measured as a ratio of orange (Her-2) fluorescent foci to green (CEP 17) fluorescent foci. A positive result is a ratio >2.2, and a negative result is a ratio <1.8.  A ratio between 1.8-2.2 is considered equivocal amplification.  References   1) Wolff A.C. et al.

This has been done as part of our quality assurance\npolicy, and she concurs with the diagnosis.\n\n<CLINICAL INFO>\nHistory of mantle cell lymphoma in 2003 with recurrence in 2009. ICD-9\nCode(s): 785.6\n\n<GROSS>\nA. A specimen labeled \"**NAME[BBB, AAA]\" and designated \"right parotid\nmass/lymph node\" per requisition is received in 30 ml of CytoLyt on\n**DATE[Mar 30 2012]. Prepared are one alcohol-fixed cytocentrifuge Pap-stained\nslide and one cell block. Also received on **DATE[Mar 30 2012] are three\nalcohol-fixed direct smears and three air-dried direct smears unlabeled\nand designated \"right parotid mass/lymph node\" per requisition. The\nalcohol-fixed smears are Papanicolaou stained and the air-dried smears\nare Diff-Quik-stained. (rc/gdb)\n\nB. A specimen labeled \"**NAME[BBB, AAA]\" and designated \"right parotid\nmass lymph node\" is received in tissue media for flow cytometry analysis\non **DATE[Mar 30 2012]. Flow cytometry analysis is performed on that material.\n(acb/jmk)\n\n<MICROSCOPIC>\nA.  Examination of the smears and cytospins reveals a cellular sample\nwith predominantly lymphocytes present. No epithelial cells are seen.\nOccasional stromal fibrous tissue fragments are identified. Occasional\nother inflammatory cells to include histiocytes and neutrophils are\npresent. The lymphocytes appear to be predominantly small\nwell-differentiated and occasional intermediate-sized lymphocytes\nshowing slight nuclear membrane irregularities. There is a small\npopulation of large atypical lymphoid cells with nuclei containing\ngranular chromatin and no significant or prominent nucleoli.\n\nIMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY STUDY:\nDeparaffinized sections of formalin-fixed tissue and the appropriate\ncontrols are incubated with a panel of antibodies or a specific\nfluorescein-labeled (oligo)nucleotide probe.  Localization is via one or\nall of the following three systems: Alkaline Phosphatase multimer-based\nmethod, indirect biotin streptavidin immunoperoxidase method, and biotin\nfree multimer immunoperoxidase method.

The abnormal B-cell population comprises 93.7% of the white blood\ncells.  The immunophenotypic findings are consistent with recurrent\nmantle cell lymphoma. However, documentation of cyclin D1 expression by\nimmunocytochemistry, or the t(11;14) by FISH could be considered for\nconfirmation.\n\nFlow cytometry histograms interpreted by **NAME[ZZZ YYY], M.D.\n\nFlow Cytometry Images\n\nAntibodies tested: CD2, CD3, CD4, CD5, CD7, CD8, CD10, CD16, CD19, CD20,\nCD23, CD25, CD38, CD45, CD56, CD57, Kappa and Lambda.\n\nThese tests were developed and the performance characteristics\ndetermined by Cellnetix Pathology and Laboratories.

Due to the cautery artifact, the\nmorphology of these glands cannot be well discerned. A triple stain was\nattempted, and while there is no definite differential staining to suggest\na basal layer, due to the cautery artifact, interpretation is not\ndefinitive. This may represent a microscopic focus of carcinoma; however\nthis interpretation is inideterminate.\n\nINTRAOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:\nFSA:  Bladder neck:  Negative for tumor.  (XX)\nGROSS DESCRIPTION:  Number of specimen containers: 4.  Labeled with patient\nname: **NAME[AAA BBB], MRN: **ID-NUM.\nA.   Container designation: \"Bladder neck\" --  The specimen consists of\nthree tan-pink fragments of tissue measuring 1.2 x 0.6 x 0.3, 0.5 x 0.4 x\n0.3 and 0.3 x 0.2 x 0.2 cm.  The fragments are submitted for frozen now\nentirely for permanent in A1.\nB.  Container designation: \"Ileal obturator lymph nodes\" --  The specimen\nconsists of a 4 x 3.2 x 1.1 cm fragment of fibroadipose tissue.  Careful\npalpation of the tissue reveals a single 1.1 cm presumed lymph node which\nis bisected and submitted entirely in B1.  The remainder of the tissue is\nsubmitted in B2 and B3.\nC.  Container designation: \"Right obturator lymph node\" --  The specimen\nconsists of a single fragment of fibroadipose tissue measuring 3.2 x 1.7 x\n0.8 cm.  The specimen is carefully palpated with no definitive lymph nodes\nidentified.  Possible lymph nodes are submitted whole in C1.  The remainder\nof the tissue is submitted in C2 and C3.\nD.  Container designation: \"Prostate\" --  The specimen consists of a 45 gm\nradical prostatectomy specimen measuring 3.5 cm from apex to base, 4.8 cm\nlaterally and 3.2 cm anterior posteriorly.  The urethra is probe patent.\nThe posterior bladder surface is smooth and intact.  The anterior and basal\nsurface have prominent cautery artifact.  Also attached are bilateral vas\ndeferentia and seminal vesicles.  The prostate has a firm spongy\nconsistency and is vaguely nodular.  The exterior surface of the prostate\nis differentially inked as follows: left anterior   blue, left posterior\ngreen, right anterior   black, right posterior   red.  The prostate has\nbeen serially sectioned from apex to base revealing multiple yellow-tan\nnodules imbedded in a pink tan stroma.  The nodules are present in all\nquadrants of the prostate.  There is no grossly apparent extension beyond\nthe prostatic parenchyma, however a prominent portion is present within 0.1\ncm of the inked posterior margin in the mid prostate.  Cassette summary: D1\nand D2   right and left apex, respectively (level one), D3 and D4   right\nand left level two, D5 and D6   right and left level three, D7 and D8\nposterior right and left level six, D9 and D10   lateral right and left\nlevel five, D11   left insertion of seminal vesicle into prostate base, D12\n  left representative vas deferens and seminal vesicle, D13   right seminal\nvesicle insertion into prostate base, D14   representative right vas and\nseminal vesicle, D15   right and left prostate base.\n\n(Dictated by: **NAME[ZZZ YYY], MD)\nMICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION: Histologic examination performed.\n\nThe staff pathologist was present during the formal review and\ninterpretation of all slides and ancillary studies, (if performed), with\nthe medical student or resident.\n\n\n\n**NAME[XXX WWW], MD\nPathologist\nElectronically signed **DATE[Dec 08 2012] 10:57 AM\nSPECIMENS SUBMITTED:\nA.

Preliminary findings were discussed with Dr. **NAME[ZZZ YYY] on **DATE[Oct 22 2011].\nGrossDescription:\nReceived in formalin, labeled \"right colon\" is a segment of small bowel (12 cm in length by 3.5 cm in diameter) and a segment of large bowel (15 cm in length by 4 cm in diameter).  A smooth tan appendix (6.9 x 0.7 x 0.6 cm) is attached to the cecum of the large bowel.  The serosa of the small and large bowel are smooth, tan-red.  The proximal and distal resection margins are stapled.  The staples are removed and the revised proximal and distal resection margins are inked black.  The radial resection margin is also inked black.  The specimen is opened to reveal tan mucosa.  Two possible tan polyps (0.2 x 0.2 x 0.1 cm and 0.3 x 0.2 x 0.1 cm) are found in the large bowel located 9 cm and 8 cm away from the distal resection margin, respectively.  A large firm mass causes a complete obstruction at the ileocecal junction (5 x 4 x 4 cm).  Upon sectioning the obstructed area reveals a firm and fibrous tan-yellow submucosal mass (approximately 3.5 x 3 x 3 cm) located at the ileocecal junction and at the base of the appendix.  The mass grossly approaches 11 cm within the proximal resection margin, 13.5 cm within the distal resection margin, 3 cm within the radial resection margin and grossly appears to extend to the serosal surface.  Representative sections are submitted as follows:\n\nBlock Summary:\n1)  -  Perpendicular section of proximal resection margin.\n2)  -  Perpendicular section of distal resection margin.\n3)  -  En face section of radial resection margin.\n4)  -  Section of proximal end of appendix.\n5)  -  Additional cross sections of appendix.\n6)  -  Section of distal tip of appendix.\n7)  -  Two possible polyps found in large bowel.\n8)  -  Section of mass with base of appendix.\n9-16)  -  Additional sections of submucosal mass.\n17)  -  Section of mass with polypoid obstruction.\n18)  -  Sections of grossly normal small bowel proximal from the mass.\n19)  -  Sections of grossly normal large bowel distal from the mass. \n20)  -  Six possible lymph nodes.\n21)  -  Six possible lymph nodes.\n22)  -  Six possible lymph nodes.\n23)  -  Six possible lymph nodes.\n24)  -  Six possible lymph nodes.\n25)  -  Six possible lymph nodes.\n26)  -  Six possible lymph nodes.\n27)  -  Six possible lymph nodes.\n28)  -  Three possible lymph nodes.\n29)  -  One possible lymph node.\nMicroscopicDescription:\nThe microscopic findings support the diagnosis.\nA: Right colon\nAddendumComment:\nIn addition to the one lymph node noted in the initial report to be involved with carcinoma by direct extension, one other node shows 7 PCK positive tumor cells in the subcapsular sinus (positive for isolated tumor cells).  The PCK stain was examined after the initial report was generated.  The presence if isolated tumor cells in this other lymph node is of uncertain clinical significance.\n"

Stains for CK20, TTF-1, and Napsin are negative.  The staining battery is supportive, except for the TTF-1 stain which is typically positive in 82% of small cell carcinomas.  However, since the overall morphology is typical for small cell carcinoma, we designated it as such.\n\nThis case discussed with Drs. **NAME[ZZZ] and **NAME[YYY].  \n\nSpecimen signed out at **STREET-ADDRESS, **PLACE, HI  **ZIP-CODE.\nGrossDescription:\nReceived in formalin, labeled with the patients name and birth date but without specimen type, are five soft tan-white cores ranging from 0.3 to 1 cm in length by less then 0.1 cm in diameter.

In non-small cell lung\ncancer, this type of activating EGFR mutation is reported to correlate with\nresponsiveness to anti-EGFR tyrosine kinase therapy. This real time PCR assay\nhas been validated to identify the most common EGFR tyrosine kinase domain\nmutations that involve exons 18-21. This test is validated for non-small cell\nlung carcinoma. The clinical significance and use of this assay in other tumor\ntypes is not well characterized. Note that this assay is not intended to\ndiagnose any particular type of cancer, but as an aid to clinicians, is\nintended to be used as an adjunct to other prognostic factors to select\neligible patients for therapy. (**NAME[ZZZ:YYY] et al., NEJM 2004;**ID-NUM, Mok\net al., NEJM 2009; **ID-NUM, Pao et al., JClinOnc 2005; **ID-NUM).\nMATERIAL RECEIVED\nA1 = ***PATH-NUMBER[1], B1, 1 Block (**DATE[Apr 10 2012])\nPROCEDURE DATE\n**DATE[Apr 09 2012]\nCLIENT REQUEST / CLINICAL HISTORY\nEGFR by PCR \nEGFR PCR METHODS\nThis real time PCR test (Qiagen/DxS) detects the most common activating\nmutations in EGFR, which have been identified in human lung non-small cell\ncancer involving codons 18-21, and leading to the following types of\nmutations: exon 19 deletions (detects any of 19 deletions but does not\ndistinguish between the types), L858R, L861Q, G719X (detects G719S, G719A, and\nG719C, but does not distinguish between the types), S768I, and exon 20\ninsertions (detects any of 3 insertions but does not distinguish between the\ntypes). These mutations account for the vast majority of all activating EGFR\nmutations. Using control materials that contain the L858R and exon 19\ndeletions, which account for ~86% of known EGFR activating mutations, this\nassay has been validated to detect these mutations at a level of 1%. Purified\ngenomic DNA is extracted from microdissected tumor specimen, is analyzed by\nlow volume spectrophotometry, and then used as sample DNA in a real time PCR\nassay using fluorescently labeled and non-labeled primers to detect wild-type\nand mutated EGFR. Sample delta Ct values for mutant and control reactions are\ncalculated and compared against threshold delta Ct values in each mutant\nreaction to determine the presence of each individual mutation type. Negative\nand positive controls are assayed with each sample. The assay sensitivity is\nestimated to be ~1% tumor involvement for each mutation type detected. \nMETHOD LIMITATIONS: Tumor samples are non-homogeneous and data from a sample\nof tumor may not be concordant with data from other sections of the same\ntumor. Tumor samples may also contain non-tumor tissue, and DNA from these\nareas would not be expected to contain a EGFR mutation. Although this assay\nproduces short PCR products, it may not work on heavily fragmented DNA. In\ninstances where the frequency of a target mutation is very low with respect to\nthe wild-type background (<1%), this assay may fail to detect the mutation,\nleading to a false-negative result.     \n    Electronically signed **DATE[Apr 14 2012]: **NAME[XXX WWW], MD-Pathologist\n M.D., Pathologist\nPer CMS regulations, the pathologist's signature above indicates that this\ncase has been reviewed and the diagnosis made or confirmed by said\npathologist.\nNote: Some of the tests reported here may have been developed and performance\ncharacteristics determined by PhenoPath Laboratories. They have not been\ncleared or approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). However,\nthe FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary.\nPursuant to the requirements of CLIA, this laboratory has established and\nverified the accuracy and precision of all tests, and additional information\nabout these tests is available upon request. PhenoPath Laboratories is\ncertified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA)\nas qualified to perform high complexity clinical laboratory testing.\n\n"

In addition, there is dim, partial expression for T cell marker, CD7 and no significant expression for TdT or other surface or cytoplasmic antigens associated with T- or B-lineage differentiation.  \n\nThere is also a CD45 (moderate intensity) abnormal monocyte population (moderate in size by light scatter; with higher side scatter characteristics, 56% of all cells) which expresses CD4 (dim), CD11b (strong), CD13 (strong), CD14 (My4, partial), CD15 (moderate), CD16 (partial), CD33, CD36 (dim-moderate), CD38, CD56 (dim, partial), CD64 (moderate), and myeloperoxidase.  There is no significant expression for CD7, CD14 (Mo2), CD34, and CD117.  \n\nThe overall findings are interpreted as showing a CD33 positive acute myeloid leukemia with monocytic features.\n\nThis test has not been cleared or approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, but the FDA does not require this test to go through premarket FDA review.  **INSTITUTION Pathology Laboratory, which is regulated under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA) as qualified to perform high complexity clinical testing, has developed this test's performance characteristics.  This test should be used for clinical purposes and should not be regarded as investigational or research.\n"

Received fresh, previously opened and unoriented, labeled \"XXXXXX, **NAME[AAA], sigmoid colon\" is an unoriented segment of pink-tan, intestinal tissue measuring up to 13.5 cm in length x 9.0 cm in greatest circumference. There is a well-circumscribed, centrally ulcerated and necrotic tumor measuring 5.3 x 4.2 x 0.5 cm.  The tumor is approximately 2.7 cm away from one margin, which has been inked blue, and approximately 5.5 cm away from the opposite margin, which has been inked orange.  The mass is nearly circumferential.  The underlying fat and serosal surface is inked black beneath the tumor.  Sectioning of the tumor reveals that it penetrates through the muscularis propria and does extend to the serosa and fat.  There are two suspicious, shaggy-appearing areas at the blue margin.  Examination of the fat reveals multiple lymph nodes, ranging from 0.7 cm to 0.2 cm in greatest dimension.  \n\n  KEY TO CASSETTES:\n  A1    -  Orange shave margin\n  A2    -  Blue shave margin and one perpendicular representative section of the margin\n  A3-A7    -  Tumor and deepest penetrating area through the serosa\n  A8-A10    -  Tumor and extension into the fat\n  A11, A12  -  Shaggy area #1\n  A13, A14  -  Shaggy area #2\n  A15    -  Three lymph nodes\n  A16    -  Three lymph nodes\n  A17    -  Two lymph nodes\n  A18    -  One lymph node (trisected)\n  A19    -  One lymph node\n  A20    -  Two lymph nodes\n  A21    -  Three lymph nodes\n  A22    -  Two lymph nodes \n\n        Lymph nodes within cassettes within A15-A19 are lymph nodes underlying the tumor, and lymph nodes in cassettes A20-A22 \n        are lymph nodes present closer to the orange-inked margin.  \n\nB.  Received in formalin, labeled \"XXXXXX, colon donut anastomosis\" are two soft, tan-gray, unoriented segments of intestinal tissue, the larger of which measures up to 2.0 x 2.0 x 1.6 cm in greatest dimension.  The smaller piece measures approximately 2.9 x 1.3 x 0.9 cm in greatest dimension.  Both specimens appear to be unoriented and are partially lined by mucosa-line soft tissue.  Representative sections of the larger specimen are submitted in cassette B1.  Representative sections of the smaller specimen are submitted in cassette B2.\nMicroscopicDescription:\nA-B.

Within the desmoplastic stroma are scattered round to oval cells which stain positively with both cytokeratin AE1/AE3 (establishing an epithelial origin) and estrogen receptor (ER).  The findings are consistent with metastatic lobular carcinoma.  The immunohistochemical stains were performed on sections of the decalcified, formalin-fixed, and paraffin-embedded bone biopsy; all controls react appropriately.  Of note, the small amount of residual background marrow that is present demonstrates trilineage hematopoiesis.\n\nIntradepartmental consultation with Dr. **NAME[ZZZ YYY] on **DATE[Oct 14 12].

The nodule measures approximately 1.2 x 0.7 x 0.6 cm. in greatest dimensions.  The external surface is marked with black ink.  The specimen is sectioned and submitted in toto in A. The thyroid lobe weighs 5 grams and measures 4.2 x 2.5 x 1.2 cm. in greatest dimensions. There is a defect near one pole.  The external surface is brown-gray and slightly irregular. On sectioning, near the opposite pole of the defect is seen a round white oval structure measuring approximately 0.7 cm. in diameter.  The remainder of the cut surface of the thyroid is reddish-brown and granular.  Representative sections are submitted in B-E with the white nodule in B-D.           PATHOLOGY REPORT   \\T\\a9.3L   \nMICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION   Sections consist of segments of thyroid gland within which is seen a focus of classical type papillary thyroid carcinoma.  Tumor cells in papillary-like formations and have enlarged round nuclei with nuclear clearing and numerous linear grooves.  The tumor extends through a thick capsule into the surrounding benign thyroid tissue.  In one area is seen a small individual malignant acini several millimeters from the tumor.  The tumor extends to within less than 1 mm of the surgical margin focally.  Maximum tumor size is 1 cm.  Lymphovascular invasion is not identified.  Extrathyroidal extension is not noted.   A second smaller 3 mm diameter tumor is noted in the thyroid consisting of a Hurthle cell adenoma.   The second separately received segment of thyroid gland appears to be that of a benign adenoma. \nSPECIMEN   RIGHT LOBE THYROID --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------     --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                   PATHOLOGY REPORT\n"

Container designation: \"left kidney and adrenal gland\"   The specimen\nconsists of a left kidney and adrenal gland weighing in total 650 gm and\nmeasuring 21 x 14 x 8 cm.  The surrounding perirenal fat varies in\nthickness from 1 to 3 cm.  Extending from the renal pelvis is a ureter (7.5\ncm in length, 0.3 cm in diameter) renal artery (1.5 cm in length, 0.6 cm in\ndiameter) and renal vein (1.0 cm in length, 1.1 cm in diameter).  The\nureter, renal artery and renal vein are all opened to reveal patent lumens\nwith no grossly visible involvement of tumor.  Located primarily in the\nlower pole is a 6.9 x 5.9 x 5.5 diffuse, poorly circumscribed golden yellow\ntumor without areas of necrosis.  The tumor pushes against the renal\ncapsule and in areas appears to possibly penetrate the capsule and invade\ninto the perirenal fat, but tumor is not present at the deep surgical\nmargin. The tumor does not appear to invade into the ureter, renal artery\nor renal vein.  The remainder of the renal cortex is brown with a\nwell-defined cortico-medullary junction.  The renal pelvis and calices are\ncovered with smooth glistening mucosa.  The adrenal gland consists of\nnormal medulla and cortex without focal lesions.  Representative cassettes\nare submitted as follows:  A1   margins of ureter, renal vein and renal\nartery; A2   adrenal gland; A3-A5   renal capsule and perirenal fat with\narea of possible tumor penetration through the capsule in A3; A6-A7   tumor\nand adjacent hilar fat; A8   tumor adjacent to normal-appearing parenchyma;\nA9   additional section of tumor; A10   normal-appearing parenchyma.\n\n(Dictated by: **NAME[YYY XXX], MD)\nMICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION: Histologic examination performed.\n\nThe staff pathologist was present during the formal review and\ninterpretation of all slides and ancillary studies, (if performed), with\nthe medical student or resident.\n\n\n\n**NAME[WWW VVV], MD\nPathologist\nElectronically signed **DATE[Apr 02 2012] 05:24 PM\nSPECIMENS SUBMITTED:\nA.

Received in formalin labeled with the patient's name and designated 'right breast, upper inner' consists of two unoriented fibrofatty tissue fragments together weighing 19.7 gm.  \nThe first fibrofatty tissue fragment measures 5.9 x 2 x 0.7 cm.  One very slightly convex yellow lobulated to tan flat aspect is inked blue and the opposite flat to very slightly concave rubbery tan-pink, slightly coarse aspect is inked black.  Tissue is serially sectioned revealing uniform soft to rubbery tan-pink to yellow fibrofatty cut surfaces throughout.  This tissue fragment is entirely submitted sequentially in cassettes A1-A5.  \nThe second tissue fragment in part A measures 5.3 x 3.5 x 2 cm.  A localization guidewire is partially embedded near one edge of the specimen.  No orientation is provided.  This tissue fragment is inked blue and serially sectioned into seven slices revealing a circular metal clip in slice 2 abutting the blue inked margin.  The cut surfaces otherwise show uniform rubbery tan-yellow fibrofatty tissue throughout with no discrete masses, lesions, or areas of induration.  This tissue fragment is entirely submitted sequentially as follows:  A6-A7 perpendicular sections of slice 1, A8-A12 slices 2-6 submitted sequentially, A13-A14 perpendicular sections of slice 7.\nB.  Received in formalin labeled with the patient's name and designated 'right breast, upper outer (wire lateral/clip anterior)' consists of an oriented fibrofatty tissue fragment weighing 13.3 gm and measuring 5.3 cm from medial to lateral, 3.5 cm from anterior to posterior and 1.5 cm from superior to inferior.  The tail end of the localization guidewire extends from the lateral aspect and the metal surgical clip is identified on the anterior aspect.  With the provided orientation, the specimen is differentially inked to allow for microscopic evaluation of surgical resection margins as follows:  superior - blue, inferior - green, posterior - black, anterior - yellow, medial - purple, lateral - orange.  The specimen is serially sectioned from medial toward lateral into nine slices revealing uniform soft tan-yellow fibrofatty cut surfaces throughout.  There are no discrete masses, lesions or areas of induration identified.  Specimen is entirely submitted sequentially as follows:\nB1-B2 perpendicular sections of slice 1, B3-B9 slices 2-8 submitted sequentially, B10-B11 perpendicular sections of slice 9.\nC.  Received in formalin labeled with the patient's name and designated 'additional tissue inferior margin, clip old margin' consists of a rubbery fibrous irregular tissue fragment measuring 3.6 x 2 x 0.9 cm and weighing 4.3 gm.  The old margin designated by a single metal surgical clip is inked black and the opposite new margin is inked blue.  Tissue is serially sectioned into eight slices revealing uniform soft to rubbery tan-white to dusky purple-red fibrofatty cut surfaces.  There are no discrete masses or areas of induration identified.  The specimen is entirely submitted sequentially in cassettes C1-C4.\n**INITIALS  **DATE[Jul 1 12]\n\n<MICROSCOPIC>\nA.  Sections, including those demonstrating the microscopic margins, are examined.  In addition, tissue block A7 was evaluated immunohistochemically with smooth muscle myosin heavy chain, p63, and E-cadherin immunostains.  These immunostains demonstrate a focus of invasive carcinoma characterized by absence of a smooth muscle myosin heavy chain/p63 myoepithelial layer.  The E-cadherin immunostain is negative in this area of invasive carcinoma, which is a characteristic finding of invasive lobular carcinoma.\nB.

As this case demonstrates 2+ staining for HER-2/neu, HER-2/neu by FISH will be performed and an addendum will be issued once the study is complete.  \n_____________________________________________________________________\nImmunohistochemical evaluation is performed by manual quantitative/semiquantitative morphometric analysis.\nImmunohistochemical evaluation of estrogen receptor is performed is using DAKO monoclonal  mouse antihuman estrogen receptor alpha clone 1D5.  Progesterone receptor evaluation is performed using DAKO monoclonal mouse antihuman progesterone receptor clone PgR636.  Ki-67 evaluation is performed using DAKO monoclonal mouse antihuman  Ki-67 antigen clone MIB-1.  Her-2 neu evaluation is performed using DAKO polyclonal rabbit antihuman c-erbB-2 oncoprotein code No. A 0485.  Unless otherwise indicated, these studies are performed using the DAKO auto stainer used with paraffin embedded formalin-fixed sections which have undergone heat-induced epitope retrieval in Target Retrieval Solution.  DAKO Envision+/HRP kit is used for visualization.\n*  If less than 1% of tumor cells are positive for estrogen or progesterone receptor, the tumor is considered to be negative for hormone receptor expression per ASCO-CAP 2010 guidelines.\n**  A false negative cannot be ruled out in the presence of inadequate controls.\n*** Negative (0) - no staining or membrane staining < 10% tumor cells.\n   Negative (1+) - faint partial membrane staining > 10% tumor cells.\n   Weak positive (2+) - weak to moderate complete membrane staining > 10% tumor cells.\n   Strong positive (3+) -  uniform intense complete membrane staining > 30% tumor cells.\n****  When discordance exists between cell proliferation as determined by ki-67 antigen and histologic mitotic count, the           \nhigher of the two determinations should be used.  Ki-67 antigen is sensitive to tissue fixation and may show a falsely low  proliferation index.\n\n\n<ADDENDUM>\nIMMUNOCYTOCHEMICAL CANCER MARKER STUDIES REPORT\nESTROGEN RECEPTOR:    POSITIVE\n*Percent cells positive:  98%\nStaining intensity:     Strong\n  Internal Controls:    Positive\nPROGESTERONE RECEPTOR:  POSITIVE\n  *Percent cells positive:  48%\n  Staining intensity:         Weak\n  Internal Controls:    Positive\nCerbB2 (HER-2 NEU) ONCOGENE OVEREXPRESSION:  \n          INDETERMINATE\n  ***Score:        2+ (32% of cells demonstrate moderate membranous\n            staining).\n  Internal Controls:    Present\nKi-67 Antigen:****      Low (<10%)\n  \nPercent cells positive:    3%, HER-2 by FISH was performed at PhenoPath Laboratories and was found to be negative for gene amplification.

The greatest radiographic dimension noted was 1.2 cm.  Clinical correlation is recommended. HER-2/neu (c-erbB-2) Immunohistochemistry Using appropriate positive and negative controls, the test for the presence of this oncoprotein is performed by the immunoperoxidase method, and reported according to the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO)/College of American Pathologists (CAP) Guideline Recommendations (2006). IMMUNOHISTOCHEMICAL INTERPRETATION:  CELL MEMBRANE STAINING ONLY (DAKO Polyclonal Rabbit Anti-Human c-erB-2 Oncoprotein Antibody) NEGATIVE:  Score 0 (No staining is observed or membrane staining is observed in less than 10% of the tumor cells). NEGATIVE:  Score 1+ (A faint/barely perceptible membrane staining is seen in more than 10% of the tumor cells.  The cells are only stained in part of their membrane). WEAK POSITIVE:  Score 2+ (A weak to moderate complete membrane staining is observed in more than 10% of the tumor cells). STRONG POSITIVE:  Score 3+ (A strong complete membrane staining is observed in more than 30% of the tumor cells). The results of this test are for investigational purposes as its performance characteristics have not been established.  It should be noted that according to the literature, the sensitivity for immunohistochemical HER-2/neu determination is no greater than 80% when compared to molecular or FISH methods. Primary antibody:  C-erb B.2 oncoprotein (polyclonal rabbit Dako ID# A0485) Detection system:  Dakocytoenvision (+) R System HRP (DAB) The immunohistochemical test(s) were developed and the performance characteristics determined by the **INSTITUTION Pathology.

Please\nevaluate for APL.\nCASE: ***path number ***\nPATIENT: **NAME[AAA BBB\nDIAGNOSIS:\nBONE MARROW ASPIRATE; FLOW CYTOMETRIC ANALYSIS:\n- ACUTE MYELOID LEUKEMIA, IMMUNOPHENOTYPE MOST SUGGESTIVE OF ACUTE\nPROMYELOCYTIC LEUKEMIA (SEE COMMENT)\n\nCOMMENT:\nFlow cytometric analysis identifies an increased number of\nblasts/promyelocytes (81%) in this bone marrow aspirate specimen that\nexpress CD117, CD33, CD13, subset CD56, dim CD45, and dim CD64. The\nmajority of blasts lacks CD34, CD15 and show loss of HLA-DR expression,\nmost compatible with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL).  This diagnosis is\nfurther suggested by the limited morphology (cytospin preparation).  A\ndefinitive diagnosis of APL requires FISH/cytogenetic confirmation. FISH\nfor t(15;17) is in progress, as is cytogenetic analysis, and will be\nreported separately.  As blast percentages in bone marrow specimens are\naltered by hemodilution and lysis of red blood cell precursors, the blast\npercentage may not be accurate and is best determined by morphologic\nevaluation. Correlation with the bone marrow morphology and clinical\nfindings is required for complete interpretation of the findings.\n\nThe results were discussed with Dr. **NAME[ZZZ] on **DATE[Oct 30 11].\n\nMORPHOLOGY:\nThe cytospin preparation shows a prominent population of intermediate to\nlarge sized blasts. The intermediate sized blasts have a high nuclear to\ncytoplasmic ratio, fine nuclear chromatin, and moderately abundant\ncytoplasm. The larger cells have irregular nuclear contours, prominent\nnucleoli, and more abundant granulated cytoplasm with an appearance most\nsuggestive of neoplastic promyelocytes (blast equivalents).  Auer rods are\npresent with more than one Auer rod detected in some cells.\n\nFLOW CYTOMETRY:\nViability:  80%\nThe following antigens were examined: CD3  CD4  CD7  CD8  CD10  CD13  CD14\nCD15  CD19  CD20  CD33  CD34  CD36  CD45  CD56  CD64  CD117  HLA-DR  kappa\nlambda\n\nBlasts:\nIncreased blasts identified, see comment above.  Approximately 5% of cells\nexpress CD34. The blasts do not express CD19, CD10, CD4, CD14, CD36, or\nCD15.\n\nLymphoid population:\nPolytypic B-cells account for 1% of total events and have a normal\nkappa:lambda light chain ratio of 1.6:1.\n\nApproximately 11% of total events are mature T-cells with a normal CD4:CD8\nratio of 1.5:1 and normal pan T-cell antigen expression with the antibodies\nexamined.\n\nMyeloid/monocyte populations:\nA minority of recorded events (6%) are CD33 positive maturing myeloid\ncells.\n\n\nIf images are listed within this report, they can be viewed by authorized\nusers on **WEB-LOC, Pathology Express.\n\nThis test was developed and its performance characteristics determined by\nXXXXX.  It has not been cleared or approved by the\nU.S. Food and Drug Administration.  The FDA has determined that such\nclearance or approval is not necessary.  This test is used for clinical\npurposes.  It should not be regarded as investigational or for research.\nThis laboratory is certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement\nAmendments of 1988 (CLIA) as qualified to perform high complexity clinical\ntesting.\n\nThe staff pathologist was present during the formal review and\ninterpretation of all slides and ancillary studies (if performed) with the\nmedical student or resident.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**NAME[YYY XXX] WWW], PhD\nXXXXX Hematopathologist\nElectronically signed **DATE[Oct 30 2011] 11:53 AM\nSPECIMEN:\n\n\nReferral ID #:\n# Unstained Slides:\n# Stained Slides:\n# Blocks:\nSpecimen Type:      Bone Marrow\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA: CD117+ blasts (red)\nA: CD13+, loss of HLA-DR\nA: Majority CD34- CD15-\n"

A mucicarmine stain is essentially negative with a very\nrare mucin positive vacuole.  This staining profile would be consistent\nwith a gynecologic malignancy.  The histologic appearance is unlike an\nendometrial carcinoma, and an ovarian primary is favored. Breast cancer is\nnot completely excluded by the negative GCDFP15.\nMICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION: Histologic examination performed.\n\n\nThe staff pathologist was present during the formal review and\ninterpretation of all slides and ancillary studies, (if performed), with\nthe medical student or resident.\n\n\n\n\n**NAME[ZZZ YYY], MD\nPathologist\nElectronically signed **DATE[Jul 28 2012] 11:53 AM\nMATERIALS SUBMITTED:\nStained slides:  Received 13 slides labeled ( ***path number *** ) from **INSTITUTION\nUnstained slides:  None\nParaffin blocks:  None\nOther:  Pathology Report numbering 1 corresponding to the slides received.\n"

Specimen one is received fresh for frozen section diagnosis and is labeled \\\"right fallopian tube and ovary\\\" and consists of the aforementioned weighing 60.5 grams and measuring 7 x 4 x 6 cm in greatest dimension.  There is a purple-tan cystic structure extruding from a more firm pink-tan area measuring 3 cm in diameter and another pedunculated area of small cystic structures and firm areas extends on a thread of connective tissue which is 3 cm long and measures itself 3 x 2 x 1 cm.  An attached portion of fallopian tube is present measuring 8 cm in length by 1.5 cm in greatest diameter.  The serosal surface is inked in black and the specimen is sectioned to reveal a firm yellow-tan parenchyma containing multiple simple cystic spaces without excrescences and some hemorrhagic-filled cystic structures as well.  Representative sections are submitted from the varying architectural areas as 1FS-1 and 1FS-2.  The previously frozen 1FS-1 and 1FS-2 are entirely resubmitted as such and sections from the unfrozen tissue are submitted in cassettes A-C. Specimen two is labeled \\\"right internal iliac obturator\\\" and consists of a cluster of fibro-fatty tissue.  The total cluster measures 3 x 2.5 x 0.3 cm.  The entire cluster is fibro-fatty.  No true lymph nodes are seen.  The entire cluster is submitted in cassettes labeled 2A and 2B. Specimen three is labeled \\\"external commons\\\" and consists of two clusters of fibro-fatty rubbery tissue.  The total cluster measures 3 x 2 x 0.3 cm.  The specimen is sectioned and shows more fat.  Very little lymphoid material is identified, if any.  All of the tissue is submitted in one cassette labeled 3. Specimen four is labeled \\\"right common and periaortic\\\" and consists of a red-tan fragment of tissue.  The total cluster measures 2.5 x 1 x 0.3 cm.

The total cluster in two parts with one measuring 0.5 cm and the other measuring 1 x 0.3 cm.  Both fragments are submitted in one cassette labeled 7A. Specimen eight is labeled \\\"omentum\\\" and consists of a lace-like pattern of fatty tissue compatible with omentum which has a measurement of 8 x 4 x 0.5 cm.  Sections made perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of this portion of omentum show lobules of fatty tissue.  No lymph nodes are seen by gross inspection.  Representative sections are submitted in one cassette labeled 8A. Specimen nine is labeled \\\"cervix, uterus, left tube and left ovarie\\\" and consists of a uterus with attached ovary, left.  The uterus includes endocervical canal and a portion of the cervix.  The specimen weighs 370 grams and has a measurement of 13 cm and a width of 10 cm and a thickness of 7.2 cm.  The left ovary is tubular and cylindrical shaped and measures 6 x 2 x 2.2 cm.  The fallopian tube measures 6 cm. Greatest diameter of the ovary 5 cm.  The fimbriated end appears satisfactory.  The uterus is sectioned from the anterior posterior plane sagittally and shows a thickening and mass effect of the posterior central portion of the body of uterus.  The specimen is allowed adequate fixation prior to further section in order to preserve the tumor and the extent of tumor that might be present and degree of invasion.  The serosal surface of both these portions of the uterus is intact, smooth and uninvolved by tumor. The uterus is sectioned sagittally and now shows a satisfactory fixation process.  The left ovary and fallopian tube measures 5 x 2 cm.  The ovary is sectioned and shows well-fixed pink-tan stromal process.  Cystic follicles are present along the subcordical surface of this process.  A section of this ovary is submitted in one cassette.  A section of the fimbriated fallopian tube segment measures 5 x 1 cm.  Section is submitted in cassette labeled 9B.  No tumor is seen in these sections.  Sections of the site of the attachment of the ovary and the fallopian tube are submitted in one cassette labeled 9C.  No tumor is seen by gross inspection at this focus.  The sagittally sectioned body of the uterus is now sectioned perpendicular to the transverse axis and shows a superficial process of tumor on the endometrial surface.  A section of this process is submitted in cassette labeled 9D.  The process extends into the lower uterine segment.  A section from the lower uterine segment of the body of the uterus is submitted in cassette labeled 9E.  The process does not extend to the cervix.  Sections of the anterior and posterior lip of the cervix are submitted in cassette labeled 9F.  No tumor is seen in this extension either.  The opposite half of the body of the uterus is sectioned perpendicular to the longitudinal axis and shows the tumor size to be 1.5 cm.  The body of the uterus measures 3.7 cm from the base of the tumor.  A section showing the tumor and this involvement of the superficial portion of the endometrium reveal an extension of the tumor.  A section showing the superficial area of the tumor is submitted in cassette labeled 9G.  A section of the extent of tumor into the wall of the uterus is submitted in cassette labeled 9H.  The tumor extends on this particular focus a distance of 3 cm and the myometrium residual without tumor involvement is 1.2 cm at this focus. The serosal surface is free of metastatic disease.  Another section of the tumor that is well fixed showing the deep margin of resection of this tumor adjacent to a portion of the softened poorly fixed area is submitted in cassettes labeled 9I and 9J.\nMICROSCOPIC HISTOLOGIC TYPE: Endometrioid adenocarcinoma, not otherwise characterized HISTOLOGIC GRADE: FIGO grade 1 MYOMETRIAL INVASION: Present Depth of invasion: 0.2 cm Myometrial thickness: 3.7 cm INVOLVEMENT OF CERVIX: Not involved EXTENT OF INVOLVEMENT OF OTHER ORGANS RIGHT OVARY: Not involved LEFT OVARY: Not involved RIGHT FALLOPIAN TUBE: Not involved LEFT FALLOPIAN TUBE: Not involved MARGINS: Uninvolved by invasive carcinoma LYMPH-VASCULAR INVASION: Not identified PATHOLOGIC STAGING (pT1apN0) PRIMARY TUMOR: pT1a REGIONAL LYMPH NODES: pN0 Pelvic lymph nodes Number examined: 7 Number involved: 0 Para-aortic lymph nodes: Number examined: 2 Number involved: 0 DISTANT METASTASIS: Not applicable ADDITIONAL PATHOLOGIC FINDINGS Complex hyperplasia CLINICAL HISTORY Stein-Leventhal Syndrome ANCILLARY STUDIES (Cytology performed in interpreted at P\\T\\C Laboratories) CYTOLOGY RESULTS (11-PM-25) See separate outside report PELVIC WASHING:  Negative for malignant cells.

Left breast mass:  \n\nBreast Tumor Information:\n\nType of specimen(s):  Left breast biopsy\nHistologic Type:  Ductal carcinoma-in-situ, see comment\nSize:  High grade dysplasia and in-situ carcinoma extend over an area estimated at 1.3 cm in greatest dimension\nArchitectural pattern(s):  Predominantly solid\nNuclear grade:  Nuclear grade 3 out of 3\nNecrosis:  Not identified\nMicrocalcifications:  Not identified\nResection margins:  Margins free of in-situ ductal carcinoma\nAdditional findings:  Receptor studies requested.\nDiagnosisComment:\nThe specimen is removed at 15:55 on **DATE[Aug 7 2011] and placed in formalin at 16:28 on **DATE[Aug 7 2011].  It is submitted for processing to begin at 10:30 pm on **DATE[Aug 8 2011].\n\nPlease correlate with prior biopsy.\n\nADDENDUM:  Outside slides from initial core needle biopsy (***PATH-NUMBER[1]) shows definite invasive ductal carcinoma.  Dr. **NAME[ZZZ] has reviewed both the initial core needle biopsy and the excisional biopsy.\nGrossDescription:\nA.  Node, left axilla:  Received fresh for frozen section is a fatty lymph node.  On section, it is grossly free of tumor.  Touch preps are performed:  NO EVIDENCE OF METASTATIC CARCINOMA.  DLW 3:30 pm.  Specimen submitted for permanent sections.\n \nB.  Left breast mass:  Received is a fatty breast biopsy measuring up to 9 x 7 x 2.5 cm.  The specimen is oriented with a double suture, a single suture, and a wire.  The specimen is roughly pancake in shape.  The double suture is located on the superficial aspect of the biopsy (inked red).  The opposite bottom aspect is inked green.  A single suture is located at one medial edge (inked black) and the opposite edge is (inked blue).  The wire is located 90 degrees from the single suture.  This edge is (inked yellow) and the edge opposite to the wire is (inked orange).  On section, an ill-defined area of hemorrhagic discoloration extends over an area of 2 cm in greatest dimension.  The closest surgical margin is inked green.  Representative sections submitted through cassette B9.\nMicroscopicDescription:\nA.  Node, left axilla:  Sections of the lymph node are free of metastatic carcinoma.  Cytokeratin stains are also negative for metastatic carcinoma.\n \nB.  Left breast mass:  Slides B8 and B9 demonstrate areas suggestive of a prior biopsy with granulation tissue formation, inflammation, fibrosis, and hemorrhage.  The adjacent stroma demonstrates a duct with in-situ ductal carcinoma and comedonecrosis as well as a few small nests in which a clear myoepithelial layer is not appreciated on H and E stain.  However on myosin staining, these nests do demonstrate a myoepithelial layer.  Nuclei appear high grade.

Per outside report (**ID-NUM), immunohistochemistry stains were performed on the biopsy from **DATE[Mar 19 2012] and the tumor is negative for estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor and Her-2.  Ki-67 demonstrated a high proliferative index of >50%.\n\n<GROSS>\nReceived in formalin, labeled with the patient's name and designated 'left breast tissue, short suture at Tail of **NAME[ZZZ], long suture marks tumor skin boundary,' is a 160 gm simple left mastectomy specimen with short suture designating Tail of **NAME[ZZZ] and long suture marking tumor skin boundary, per the requisition.  The breast measures 9.1 cm from superior to inferior, 2.5 cm from anterior to posterior, 15.3 cm from medial to lateral.  A tan-pink skin ellipse is present on the anterior surface measuring 13.8 cm from medial to lateral x 8.1 cm from superior to inferior.  A V-shaped incision is present on the left tip of the skin ellipse, which measures 7.2 cm from superior to inferior, and is located 1.5 cm from the most lateral skin tip.  An everted nipple measuring 1.1 cm in diameter x 0.9 cm in length is located in the central aspect of the skin, with a 3.1 cm areolar surrounding the nipple.  The specimen is differentially inked to allow for the microscopic evaluation of surgical resection margins as follows:  anterior-superior resection margin   blue, anterior-inferior resection margin   green, and posterior resection margin   black.  Sectioning reveals a firm, round, well-circumscribed mass measuring 1.5 cm from medial to lateral, 1.3 cm from superior to inferior, and 1.3 cm from anterior to posterior.  The mass is located 0.1 cm from the closest black-inked posterior resection margin, 0.9 cm from the closest blue-inked anterior-superior resection margin, 2.0 cm from the closest green-inked anterior-inferior resection margin, 0.8 cm deep to the skin, and 7.0 cm from the nipple.  The mass is located in the lower-outer quadrant.  The mass has a tan-white homogeneous and rubbery cut surface.  The mass is located 0.9 cm deep to the skin incision.  Located 1.0 cm from the mass is an ill-defined nodule area of tan-white dense fibrous tissue, measuring 2.5 x 1.0 x 1.0 cm.  A localization clip is identified within the central portion of the mass.  The breast immediately deep to the nipple is tan-white to chalky white soft and friable, grossly appearing to be necrotic.  The remaining uninvolved breast tissue consists of approximately 40% tan-white dense fibrous tissue admixed with 60% tan-yellow, glistening and lobulated unremarkable breast tissue.  Representative sections are submitted.  Summary of sections:  A1 nipple, A2 full thickness section through mass with closest black-inked posterior resection margin, A3 full thickness section through mass with closest blue inked anterior-superior resection margin and closest skin, A4 closest green-inked anterior-inferior margin, A5-A6 remainder of mass, A7 nodular fibrous tissue adjacent to mass, A8 soft and friable tissue deep to nipple, A9 representative upper-outer quadrant, A10 representative lower-outer quadrant, A11 representative upper-inner quadrant, A12 representative lower-inner quadrant.\nJF/cs  **DATE[May 22 12]\n\n<MICROSCOPIC>\nSections examined.

The tumor in the cecum (tumor #1) has a prominent component of tubulovillous adenoma with areas of high grade dysplasia, and only focally invades into the submucosa (multiple H\\T\\E-stained step sections examined).  The second tumor focus (tumor #2) arises from a tubular adenoma in the ascending portion of the colon, and shows more extensive invasion into the muscularis propria.  The pathologic staging is thus based on tumor #2 (pT2 N0).\n\nCase reviewed at Pathology Staff Conference on **DATE[Jul 19 11].

GTW  Signed  __________(signature on file)_ **NAME[ZZZ,YYY] XXX] MD  **DATE[May 29 12]\nGROSS DESCRIPTION The specimen is submitted in 3 containers, each labelled with the patient name. A. Submitted fresh and designated \\\"right lung mass\\\" are 2 very hemorrhagic reddish-brown biopsy specimens that are submitted for frozen sections and are now entirely submitted in cassette A. B. Submitted fresh and designated \\\"right lung mass for bronchial margins\\\", the specimen consists of a lung lobectomy specimen with staple lines present. The specimen measures up to approximately 12 x 8 x 4 cm in greatest dimensions. The staple line is partially interrupted revealing bronchial margins. The bronchial margins are submitted for frozen sections and are now submitted in cassette B1. The additional lung tissue is then perfused prior to examination. Additional stapled tissue is removed prior to further examination. The pleural surface shows a roughly sutured area measuring 2.5 cm in greatest dimension which probably represents the prior biopsy site. Possible anthracotic peribronchial lymph node structures are identified and submitted in cassette B2. Also submitted in cassette B2 are probable vascular margins of excision. The specimen is sectioned with possible pulmonary edema identified; 1.5 cm from the margin of excision (the pleural surface) is a 2.3 cm in greatest dimension hemorrhagic and necrotic appearing mass lesion. This area is sectioned and submitted in cassettes B3 through B6, with pleural surface also submitted.  Sections away from tumor, of possible emphysematous and edematous tissue, are submitted in cassette B7. C. Submitted fresh and designated \\\"station 4R lymph nodes\\\", the specimen consists of hemorrhagic and anthracotic red-brown soft tissue, with the smaller portion entirely submitted in cassette C1. The larger specimen measures up to 4 x 1.5 x 0.8 cm in greatest dimension. This is sectioned longitudinally and entirely submitted in cassettes C2 and C3. D: **DATE[May 28 2012] - 1637 hours T: **DATE[May 29 2012] - 0746 hours\nMICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION A. The sections are of lung and show a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma, with hyperchromatic nuclei, scant eosinophilic to amphophilic cytoplasm and focal mucoid production. B. The sections from the bronchial margin show bronchial tissue with the lung tissue surrounding the bronchus showing a moderate level of emphysematous change. No malignancy is seen. The sections from lymph nodes show anthracotic node and the blood vessel shows blood vessel with no tumor present. The multiple sections from the nodule show adenocarcinoma, moderately differentiated, with focal lepidic spread through the lung parenchyma. Fresh hemorrhage and emphysematous change are identified in the surrounding soft tissue. The pleural surfaces are uninvolved by tumor. Emphysematous changes are noted throughout the extra sections examined. C. The section show benign adipose tissue and fibrous tissue with benign reactive anthracotic lymph node identified. No evidence of metastatic malignancy is seen.

The specimen is received in fixative and consists of an unopened 27 cm segment of bowel with a moderate amount of attached pericolonic fat.  A surgical glove is attached to the proximal aspect of the specimen.  The serosa is pink and has dense adhesions.  The proximal margin is closed with a staple line and measures 4.7 cm in circumference.  The distal margin surrounded with anal mucosa is sutured shut and measures 8 cm in circumference.  A 0.5 x 0.3 cm ill-defined slightly invaginated area is located 4.5 cm from the distal surgical margin and 1.2 cm from the dentate line.  The tissue subjacent to this area is cauterized.  The invaginated area does not appear to extend into the bowel wall.  The radial margin is located approximately 0.3 cm from the bowel.  Dilated blood-filled submucosal vessels are present between the dentate line and the distal surgical margin.  A 0.7 x 0.4 x 0.3 cm red polypoid structure is located 8 cm from the proximal surgical margin.  The polyp moves with ease over the muscularis. Additionally received in the same container is a 2 x 2 x 0.9 cm annular piece of tissue partially covered with mucosa.  There is a small amount of attached fat.  One margin is closed with a staple line.  No discrete mass lesions are present. Additionally received in the same container is a 2.5 x 1.5 cm ellipse of tan skin excised to a depth of 2.5 cm.  The surface of the skin is unremarkable.  Representative sections are submitted as follows: 1 - perpendicular proximal margin; 2 - perpendicular distal margin; 3 and 4 - entire invaginated area; 5 - dilated blood-filled vessels; 6 - polyp; 7 - annular piece of tissue; 8 - separately received piece of skin and underlying soft tissue; 9 through 11 - multiple lymph nodes. JMM:jck\nMicroscopic Description: Sections show focal residual adenocarcinoma, present within the submucosal at its deepest point, and demonstrating features consistent with therapy effect.  There is no significant extracellular mucin production.  The focus of residual tumor measures less than 0.6 cm in greatest dimension.

D: **DATE[Nov 06 2011] - 1354 hours T: **DATE[Nov 06 2011] - 1554 hours\nMICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION Part A: Sections of the submitted mid ascending colon polyp reveal adenomatous changes of the surface mucosal tissue with relative preservation of the colonic crypt contours.  There is a mild glandular atypia.  High-grade atypia or malignancy is not seen. Part B: Sections of the biopsy of rectal polyp reveal a fragment of acutely inflamed granulation tissue.  The second biopsy fragment also displays ulceration, acute inflammation, and granulation tissue proliferation. However, there is a proliferation of atypical squamous epithelial cells with associated parakeratosis. Thee are round edged nests extending from the surface mucosa which appear to be carcinoma in situ. These squamous cells display a marked epithelial atypia and display a marked increase in mitotic activity with 7 and 8 mitotic figures in a single high-powered field. There is also one focus in which there appears to be submucosal invasion with small irregular nests separate from the overlying malignant surface epithelium.  Lymphatic invasion is not seen. Glandular differentiation is not seen.

B)  Left breast:  Infiltrating duct carcinoma, moderately differentiated, 1.0 x 1.0 x 0.4 cm, EBR score 3+3+1=7, without lymphvascular invasion.  Duct carcinoma in situ component, intermediate grade, cribriform type with central comedonecrosis.  Multiple radial scars, papillomatosis, stromal fibrosis, and marked sclerosing adenosis with luminal microcalcifications in remainder of breast parenchyma. Benign nipple.  Benign deep soft tissue resection margin.\nGross Description: A)  Received fresh designated \"left sentinel node\" is a 2.5 x 1 x 0.9 cm aggregate of yellow lobulated adipose tissue, within which is a 0.4 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm pink-tan nodule.  The nodule is bisected, touch prepped, and submitted entirely for frozen section in one block.  The specimen is now re-submitted for permanents in cassette A-FSC. B)  Received in formalin designated \"left breast\" is a 588 gm, 20 x 20 x 4 cm total mastectomy specimen.  The specimen is partially surfaced by a 10.5 x 6 cm pink-tan skin ellipse.  There is a central 2.5 cm in diameter areola with a 0.7 x 0.7 x 0.3 cm slightly retracted black inverted nipple.  The epidermal surface is notable for a 0.2 cm prior biopsy site at the 9-10 o'clock position, 4 cm from the center of the nipple.  There is no orientation provided, thus the aspect of the specimen with the larger flap of fibro-fatty tissue will be designated superior.  The posterior surface of the specimen is inked blue. Sectioning the specimen reveals a 1 x 1 x 0.4 cm biopsy cavity within the upper inner quadrant at the 11:00 o'clock position.  The biopsy cavity is packed with white pebble-like biopsy seed material.  The biopsy cavity is 0.5 cm from the nearest deep margin.  The biopsy cavity is surrounded by punctate foci of hemorrhage and fat necrosis, as well as a very ill-defined area of indurated dense white-tan fibrous breast tissue.  The indurated fibrous tissue surrounding the biopsy site measures approximately 2 x 1.5 x 1.5 cm.  There is also a small amount of indurated slightly granular fibrous tissue noted extending superiorly from the biopsy site.  There are no distinct well-circumscribed masses seen.  There are no other lesional areas identified.  The remainder of the specimen is notable for a moderate amount of dense white-tan fibrous breast tissue and multiple blue-domed cystic structures.  There are no lymph nodes identified.  Representative sections are submitted and placed in formalin at 1430 hours on **DATE[Jun 29 12]. Summary of sections:  B1 - nipple base and remainder of nipple; B2-B9 - biopsy site entirely submitted, lateral to medial to include the deep margin in cassettes B4 and B5; B10\\T\\B11 - representative sections of granular fibrous tissue extending superiorly from biopsy site; B12 - random upper outer quadrant; B13 - random lower outer quadrant; B14 - random lower inner quadrant.  JAB:jlj\nMicroscopic Description: A)  The lymph node shows a normal architecture and an intact capsule. There are mild reactive changes but no evidence of primary or metastatic neoplasm. B)  Numerous sections from around the circumference of the biopsy site reveal very complicated radial scars with complex papillomatosis.  In the center of this area, there is both an intraductal and infiltrating duct carcinoma present.  The intraductal component which makes up approximately 50% of the tumor shows very large duct structures distended by atypical epithelial cells in very complicated cribriform-type patterns with central areas of eosinophilic comedonecrosis.  The invasive portion of the tumor shows small fairly solid aggregates of epithelial cells with focal lumen formations but without well-formed tubular structures present.  These cells show small to moderate amounts of cytoplasm and contain nuclei which vary markedly from small and pyknotic up to giant vesicular nuclei with variably prominent nucleoli.  Occasional mitoses can be identified averaging 2 per 10 high-power fields.  These microscopic findings would score a 3 for tubule formation, 3 for nuclear pleomorphism, and 1 for mitotic count for a combined EBR score of 7, which is moderately differentiated. No definite lymphvascular invasion can be identified.  The neoplasm shows numerous microcalcifications.  An immunoperoxidase stain for e-cadherin reveals marked cytoplasmic positivity of the invasive neoplastic cells indicative of ductal origin.  The uninvolved breast tissue shows a localized area of stromal fibrosis in association with focal papillomatosis and fairly extensive sclerosing adenosis with numerous luminal microcalcifications.  The deep soft tissue resection margin is free by approximately 0.6 cm from the deeper most aspect of the biopsy site scar.  The nipple is unremarkable.

ER clone SP1 PR clone 1E2. Scoring Guide:  A positive result is based specifically upon positive nuclear staining within tumor cells, with an intensity graded from weak-mild to strong as noted above.  If the count is greater than 0% by IHC manual morphometry, of any intensity, the result is considered POSITIVE, with only 0% staining considered NEGATIVE. HER-2/neu Status (semiquantitative):  0; Negative Method and Interpretation Guide for HER-2/neu (C-erB-2): Performed upon routinely formalin fixed and paraffin embedded tissue (subject to false-negative results with improper and/or delayed fixation). Specimen identification: -    CASE #:  5227            BLOCK #:  B4 -    Specimen site and type:  Left mastectomy -    Time to fixation:  45 minutes -    Duration of fixation:  7 hours HER-2/neu clone 4B5. Method used:  VENTANA i VIEW PATHWAYS (FDA approved, controls high protein expression, low level protein expression, negative protein expression, internal). Adequacy of sample for evaluation:  Adequate Result interpretation:  Negative Percentage of invasive tumor cells exhibiting complete membrane staining:  0% Uniformity of staining present or absent:  Absent Homogeneous dark circumferential pattern present or absent:  Absent Scoring Guide: Staining Pattern                   Result      0    No membrane staining observed      Negative           (or membrane staining observed           in a count of less than 10% of tumor cells).      1+   Faint/partial membrane staining         Negative           (detected in a count of more than 10% of           tumor cells.  Staining may not           encircle entire cell membrane).      2+   Weak complete membrane staining,        Equivocal           observed in a count of more than 10% of tumor cells (encircling entire cell membrane).      3+   Moderate to strong (intense) complete   Positive           membrane staining observed in a count of more than 10% of tumor cells (encircling           entire cell membrane). NOTE:  The immunohistochemical methods utilized for the evaluation of ER/PR receptor status are considered semiquantitative with results expressed as detailed above.   Despite an FDA approved scoring guide that classifies 2+ immunohistochemistry results as equivocal, the literature suggests that up to 70% of these cases may be actually the fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) negative.  As such, a reflex to HER-2/neu FISH testing could be considered before administration of Herceptin therapy.  The immunohistochemistry methods utilized for the evaluation of ER/PR receptor and HER-2/neu status are considered semiquantitative, with results expressed as detailed above.  These tests were developed and their performance characteristics determined by the **INSTITUTION Pathology Department.  This laboratory is regulated under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA '88), as qualified to perform high complexity testing. **NAME[YYY XXX:  WWW M VVV] MD Pathologist Electronically Signed **DATE[Jun 31 2012]\nSpecimen Source:   APSURG\\T\\AP SURGICAL SPECIMEN\\S\\\\S\\\\S\\\\S\\\\S\\OTHR\\T\\Miscellaneous   SOURCE OF SPECIMEN: A Left sentinal node SOURCE OF SPECIMEN: B Left breast\n"

On three of the core biopsies, in areas of dense\nfibrosis, there are nests of invasive ductal breast carcinoma. The\npresence of these epithelial cells is confirmed with an immunostain for\npancytokeratin (AE1/AE3). Invasive tumor spans a greatest area of up to\n2.8 mm on a single core. \nSlides from the previous breast cancer are not in our files for a direct\nhistologic comparison but given the location within scar tissues and the\nadjacent fat necrosis this is likely near the site of a previous surgical\nprocedure and could be recurrent tumor. The possibility of a new primary\ncarcinoma arising at this site can not be completely excluded. \nIMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY (IHC) REPORT:\nANTIBODIES:RESULTS: \n1. HER2-NEU (4B5): PENDING\n2.

PANCYTOKERATIN (AE1/AE3): POSITIVE\nFixation Time:  Within Guideline Limits (See comment).\n: Negative estrogen and progesterone receptors and Her-2/neu\nresults may be unreliable in cases where fixation time is shorter than\nguideline limits suggest. \nInterpretation: Estrogen/progesterone receptor evaluation is based on the\n**NAME[XXX] Scoring system.  An **NAME[XXX] score of 3 to 8 is considered positive.\nFormalin-fixed, deparaffinized tissue sections (along with appropriate\npositive controls) are incubated with the following monoclonal and/or\npolyclonal antibodies. Localization is via a biotin-free multimer-based\nimmunoperoxidase technique according to an optimized protocol. The\ncontrols are reviewed for the appropriate positive and negative reactivity\nand found to be satisfactory. Results on the population(s) of interest are\nas indicated above. \n \nThese tests were developed and their performance characteristics were\ndetermined by the Department of Anatomic Pathology at Group Health\nCooperative.  The Laboratory is certified under CLIA-88 and is qualified\nto perform high complexity testing.  These tests have not been cleared or\napproved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. However, the FDA has\ndetermined that such clearance or approval is not necessary.\n\n"

It arises from a tubular adenoma and invades into the submucosa.  Two lymph nodes are positive (2/25).  Medullary carcinoma is a distinctive histologic type strongly associated with high levels of microsatellite instability (MSI-H), indicative of defects in the normal DNA repair gene function.  MSI testing is generally recommended in cases that show the MSI-H phenotype.\n\nSpecimen signed out at **STREET-ADDRESS, **PLACE, HI  **ZIP-CODE. |\nGrossDescription:\nReceived in formalin, labeled \"right colon\" is a segment of small bowel (3 cm in length by 2 cm in diameter) and a segment of large bowel (18 cm in length by 3 cm in diameter).  A smooth pink-tan appendix (8 x 0.8 x 0.6 cm) is attached to the cecum of the large bowel.  Both proximal and distal resection margins are inked black and the radial resection margin is inked green.  \n\nThe specimen is opened to reveal a tan-red mass (2.5 x 2.5 x 0.9 cm) which is found in the cecum at the appendiceal orifice.  The mass is grossly located 4 cm away from the proximal resection margin, 16.5 cm away from the distal resection margin and 6 cm away from the radial resection margin.  The mass does not grossly appear to penetrate through the muscularis propria.  \n\nAlso found in the large bowel are two possible polyps measuring 0.2 and 0.4 cm in greatest dimension and found 9 cm and 6 cm away from the distal resection margin respectively.  \n\nThe remainder of the specimen appears grossly normal.  \n\nRepresentative sections are submitted as follows:\n\nBlock summary:\n1.  -  Perpendicular section of proximal resection margin.\n2.  -  Perpendicular section of distal resection margin.\n3.  -  En face section of radial resection margin.\n4.  -  Cross section of proximal end of appendix.\n5.  -  Additional cross sections of appendix.\n6.  -  Distal tip of appendix.\n7-9.  -  Sections of mass, entirely submitted.\n10.  -  Two possible polyps.\n11.  -  Section of ileocecal valve.\n12.  -  Sections of small bowel.\n13-14.  -  Sections of large bowel.\n15.  -  Six possible lymph nodes.\n16.  -  Six possible lymph nodes.\n17.  -  Three possible lymph nodes.\n18.  -  Six possible lymph nodes.\n19.  -  Three possible lymph nodes.\nMicroscopicDescription:\nThe microscopic findings support the diagnosis.\nA: Right colon\n"

        "doc_raw_text": "PART / DESCRIPTION - SEQ \nBREAST,,MASTECTOMY WITH NODES/ RIGHT BREAST AND AXILLARY CONTENTS- A\nINTRAOPERATIVE DX:\nNONE\nDIAGNOSIS COMMENTS:\nThe clinical impression of a possible satellite nodule is noted. Sampling of the presumed area shows marked lymphocytic lobulitis. Although it is of some interest that the in-situ and the invasive carcinoma are accompanied by marked lymphocytic infiltrate, the lobules in the presumed area of satellite nodule do not exhibit convincing cytomorphologic or histoarchitectural features of carcinoma (or atypical ductal hyperplasia), although some reactive changes are appreciated. \n\nThe larger positive node was extensively sampled to evaluate for extranodal extension. It is extensively replaced by carcinoma which for the most part appears surrounded by dense fibrosis In one area (A20), this fibrosis is much more abundant, appears eccentric, contains a nest of carcinoma, as well as possible entrapped adipocytes; these features are interpreted as extranodal extension.\nFINAL DX:\n\nBreast and axillary contents, right, mastectomy with axillary dissection: Infiltrating carcinoma with the following features:  Histologic type:   Ductal.\nSize:     4.5 x 3.5 x 3 cm.  Histologic grade:   High, G3 of 3.  Nottingham grade:   9 of 9.   Tubule formation:    Poor (3 of 3).   Nuclear grade:   High (3 of 3).   Mitotic rate:    High (3 of 3).  Lymph-vascular invasion:  Identified, focal. Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) with the following features:  Histologic type:   Solid.  Nuclear grade:    High.  Necrosis:    Present.  Calcifications:    Rare.  Estimated size/extent of DCIS: Rare ducts with DCIS are seen in association with infiltrating        carcinoma.      Separate incidental microscopic focus of DCIS with features      similar to those reported above, identified in upper inner      quadrant at 3 cm medial and superior from main mass.\nExtensive intraductal component: Not identified. Surgical margins:  Infiltrating carcinoma:   Widely free (distance greater than 1 cm, all margins).  Ductal carcinoma in situ:   Widely free (distance greater than 1 cm, all margins). Lymph nodes:    Twenty-five lymph nodes identified.         Two lymph nodes with metastatic carcinoma (2/25).         Largest metastatic deposit: 3.5 cm.         Focal features consistent with extranodal extension identified. Pathologic stage:   pT2, pN1a (AJCC 7th edition). Additional findings:      Immunohistochemistry staining for estrogen and progesterone receptor expression and Her-2/neu overexpression have previously been performed (as per report ***PATH-NUMBER[1], slides not concurrently reviewed), with the following results: ER positive, 100% of tumor cell nuclei with strong staining, PR positive, 20-25% of tumor cell nuclei with moderate to strong staining, HER-2/neu equivocal by immunohistochemistry (score of 2+), negative for HER-2/neu gene amplification by FISH.    Nipple and skin with focal changes consistent with involvement by carcinoma at the base of the    nipple and at the deepest parts of the dermis of skin.    Two hemangiomas of skin, up to 0.4 cm.    Previous biopsy site with associated changes.    Striated muscle with no histologic abnormality is seen in some of the samples from the deep margin.\nMICROSCOPIC:\nUnless 'gross exam' is specified, the final diagnosis for each specimen is based on a microscopic examination of the tissue(s)/cells.GROSS:\nReceived fresh, labeled ''**NAME[BBB, CCC]' and designated ''right breast and axillary contents'', is an 1178-g right breast with the letter R and an arrow pointing toward axilla written on the skin with an attached 9 x 8.5 x 3.5 cm axillary tail. It has dimensions as follows: medial to lateral - 23 cm, superior to inferior - 25 cm superficial to deep - 5.5 cm. There is a 20 x 13.5 cm ellipse of skin with a 1 cm, retracted nipple. There are two, 0.4 cm in diameter, red-brown macules within the 5 and 7 o'clock skin regions, respectively, and coming to within 0.3 cm of the nearest skin margin. The specimen is inked as follows: superior superficial - orange, inferior superficial- blue, deep - black. The breast is sectioned from medial to lateral into 30 slices, numbered respectively (nipple between slices 11-12). There is a 4.5 x 3.5 x 3 cm firm white mass in slices 11-14, 4 cm from the deep margin, 4 cm from the superior superficial margin, 7 cm from the inferior superficial margin, 4 cm from the nearest skin margin, and 0.3 cm from the nipple. The remainder of the specimen consists of 90% yellow lobulated adipose tissue and 10% white fibrous tissue. There are 26 possible lymph nodes and one grossly positive lymph node identified within the axillary tail, up to 3.5 cm in diameter. Representative sections are submitted as follows: A1 - nipple, bisected and subareolar tissue; A2 - slice 10, area immediately medial to mass with separate superficial and deep; A3 - slice 11, mass with attached overlying skin and separate deep; A4 - slice 12, representative section of mass with attached subareolar tissue and skin near nipple and separate deep; A5-A6 - slice 13, mass with separate superficial and deep; A7 - slice 14, mass, with separate superficial and deep; A8 - slice 15, area immediately lateral to mass, with separate superficial and deep; A9 - slice 18, upper outer quadrant, with separate superficial and deep; A10 - slice 22, lower outer quadrant, with separate superficial and deep; A11 - slice 8, lower inner quadrant, with separate superficial and deep; A12 - slice 6, upper inner quadrant, with separate superficial and deep (3 cm medial and superior to mass, 1.5 cm from the deep margin, 2.5 cm from the superior superficial margin, 8 cm from the inferior superficial margin, 2.5 cm from the nearest skin margin, and 3.3 cm from the nipple); A13 - six possible axillary lymph nodes; A14 - six possible axillary lymph nodes; A15 - five possible axillary lymph nodes; A16 - four possible axillary lymph nodes; A17 - two possible axillary lymph nodes; A18 - two possible axillary lymph nodes; A19 - one possible axillary lymph node, serially sectioned; A20 - representative sections of grossly positive lymph node; A21 - slice 5, upper inner quadrant, directly medial to section from cassette A12, with separate superficial and deep; A22 - slice 7, immediately lateral to section from cassette A12, with separate superficial and deep; A23 - slice 16, possible satellite nodule; A24 - slice 17, possible satellite nodule; A25 - slice 15, possible satellite nodule; A26-A27 - representative additional sections of grossly positive lymph node; A28 - representative sections of skin macules. Specimen was put into formalin at approximately 4 p.m. on **DATE[Feb 02 2012] and will have a total time in formalin of 20-1/2 hours.

Clinical history:  History of breast cancer.\nCopy To:   Specimen(s) Received: Right Breast mass\nFinal Diagnosis Biopsy right breast mass;             A.     Metaplastic carcinoma, intermediate grade, spindle cell type (1.9 cm greatest diameter measured histologically).       B.     Tumor abuts against inked surgical margins of the biopsy specimen.       C.     Central areas of sclerotic scar and entrapped degenerating adipose tissue consistent with remote radiation effect.   Comment:    This case was reviewed at the **INSTITUTION **INSTITUTION Breast Pathology section  by Dr. **NAME[ZZZ M. YYY].  The above diagnosis reflects her consultative opinion.  The complete report from  **INSTITUTION is appended below.                      1  Electronically Signed Out By Ben **NAME[M. XXX], MD Results {Not Entered} Interpretation-Comments {Not Entered}\nGross Description Specimen #1 is received fresh for frozen section, labeled with the patient's name and designated \"right breast biopsy.\"  The specimen consists of a fatty tissue fragment measuring 3.5 x 3.3 x 2.0 cm.  The external surface is soft and lobulated.  The external surface is inked black.  The cut surface reveals a well-defined yellow-gray firm mass measuring 2.0 x 1.8 x 1.4 cm.  The mass abuts the resection margin.  The remaining breast tissue is yellow-pink, soft and fatty.  A representative section of the mass is submitted for frozen section.  The frozen section remnant is submitted in (block A).  The remaining mass submitted in (blocks B through D).  A representative section of unremarkable breast tissue is submitted in (block E).  **INITIALS\nMicroscopic Description Sections of right breast biopsy reveal a relatively well-delineated nodular lesion demonstrating a central area of sclerosis, scarring and entrapped degenerating adipose tissue.  This area was represented primarily in frozen section samples.  Adjacent to and peripheral to this area are foci of a spindle cell proliferation showing a much higher cellularity.  The spindle cells are arranged in a haphazard fashion with occasional formation of sheets and fascicles.  Nuclei are elongated and demonstrate a slight increase in density of chromatin.  Significant numbers of mitotic figures are observed.  The tumor abuts against the inked surgical margin of excision of the biopsy.   This case was sent in consultation to Dr. **NAME[ZZZ YYY] at **NAME[WWW] University **INSTITUTION who feels that this lesion represents a metaplastic carcinoma of intermediate grade, spindle cell type.  The malignant cells express p63, and Cytokeratins CK5/6, AE1/AE3 and are CK903 positive, which are findings characteristic of metaplastic carcinomas.

B)  Left thyroid lobe, lobectomy:  Multifocal papillary carcinoma ( largest focus 1.1 x 0.3 cm), in a background of hyperplastic thyroid, consistent with Grave's disease with patchy lymphocytic thyroiditis.\nGross Description: Two containers. A)  Container A is labeled \\\"right thyroid lobe\\\".  The specimen is received in fixative and consists of a 24 gram, 7 x 4 x 3 cm lobulated lobe of thyroid.  The specimen is inked.  A 1.5 x 1.3 x 1 cm nodule is attached to the edge of the thyroid lobe.  The cut surface is deep red and has a 0.4 x 0.3 x 0.3 cm white nodule.  The remaining cut surface has no discrete mass lesions.  Representative sections are submitted as follows: A1 - entire nodule attached to the thyroid gland; A2 - entire small white nodule; A3 through A8 - representative sections. B)  Specimen B is labeled \\\"left thyroid lobe\\\".  The specimen is received in fixative and consists of a 23 gram, 6.5 x 4 x 3 cm lobulated tan-gray lobe of thyroid.  The specimen is inked.  The cut surface is vaguely nodular and ranges from pink to red.  A single 0.4 cm solid white nodule is present.  No additional mass lesions are identified.  Representative sections are submitted as follows: B1 - entire nodule; B2 through B6 - random sections of thyroid. JMM:jck\nMicroscopic Description: A \\T\\ B)  Right and left lobes, lobectomies:  Sections from both thyroid lobes reveal similar findings demonstrating numerous thyroid follicles of varying sizes and shapes containing varying amounts of colloid. Patchy areas of lymphoid aggregates are noted, consistent with focal lymphocytic thyroiditis.  There are small Hurthle cell nodules noted also.  Some of the follicles demonstrate pseudopapillary projections within the follicles.  However, additionally, there are several foci of demonstrating nuclear features of papillary thyroid carcinoma with enlarged, hypochromatic nuclei with occasional nuclear grooves, nuclear overlapping, and an occasional intranuclear inclusion.  Two benign lymph nodes are noted.  For further details, see case summary below. CASE SUMMARY FOR PRIMARY CARCINOMA OF THE THYROID Procedure:  Right and left thyroid lobectomies.

The specimens are placed in formalin \nbetween 1325 and 1314 on **DATE[Sep 12 2011], for a total fixation time of approximately 9.5 hours. \nThe first is designated `left breast mass, 2:00, upper outer quadrant' and is a 29.0 gram \nyellow tissue, 6.0 cm from medial to lateral, 4.7 cm from superficial to deep and 2.8 cm \nfrom superior to inferior. There is an attached blue-stained skin ellipse, 3.9 x 0.7 cm. \nExtending into the lateral end of the skin ellipse is a hooked 14.0 cm in length guidewire. \nOrientation is short suture superior and long lateral. The specimen is inked as follows: \nsuperior -orange, inferior -green, superficial -blue, deep -black, lateral -yellow, and \nmedial -red. The specimen is sectioned from lateral to medial into eleven slices. On the \ncut surfaces of slices 3 through 5, there is a circumscribed firm mass. This mass is 1.2 x \n1.0 x 1.0 cm. The mass is within 0.5 cm of the orange superior and 1.0 cm or greater from \nall other margins. This area approximately corresponds to the hook of the guidewire. \n\nSummary of sections: \nA1 Slice 1, lateral margin represented, section perpendicular to margin, two pieces in \ncassette. \nA2 Slice 2, orange superior. \nA3 Slice 3, orange superior green inferior, apparent beginning of mass. \nA4 Slice 4, mass or superior green inferior. \nA5 Slice 4, skin and blue superficial. \nA6 Slice 5, mass and orange superior, greatest size of mass, orange-inked seepage has \noccurred, \nonly black over orange is true superior margin. \nA7 Slice 5, black deep. \nA8 Slice 6, mass and green inferior. \nA9 Slice 11, medial margin represented, section perpendicular to margin, three pieces in \ncassette. \nThe second is designated `left sentinel lymph node' and is an unoriented yellow-pink tissue \nmeasuring 2.5 x 2.0 x 1.5 cm. This has a 1.5 cm yellow-pink lymph node.
